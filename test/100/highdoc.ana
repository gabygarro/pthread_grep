HOW TO GET REALLY SOARING HIGH ON GATORADE - By Max Madd

Ok, first run down to the Piggly Wiggly and purchase a big old 4 pint thing full of our most
favorite beverage - Gatorade.  Then refuse the desire to eat until your stomache is empty.

Now these steps are very complex, so everybody hang on to your hats:
1. Check the expiration date to see if it's a good week.
2. Smell the cap (I don't know why, they do it to wine in French restaurants, so why not?)
3. Open your mouth and let the whole gallon slide down as fast as possible.                     
4. Trip out.

Known side effects:
1. A really cool high.
2. Slight discomfort to the back of the throat.
3. Some major kidney action and a stinging sensation when you go for a Number One.
No big deal.  I think personally that it's worth the slight discomfort, but you judge for your
own self.

Credit goes to Geewhiz for his sagely advise in this matter.  And no, you can't sue him 
either.
