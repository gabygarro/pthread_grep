			 =====================

	The first thing that you must do is decide that this is the thing for
you and that you will be able to handle this responsibility.  Things that you
need to get or have is access to a motel or some good form of shelter in which
to house the items for sale.  Next you should be located close to a large city
and have many contacts with students such as college or high school level.

You have to be in possession of an automobile.	This is extermly necessary for
transportation of girls and you to get to partys.  You must have understanding
parents that will let you leave the house on weekdays during late hours but not
later than 12 at night.  Drug dealers; they are a big help in recruting the
girls.	Girls that need some money to pay for their drug habbits are easy
targets.  They will do anyhing to keep the supply of whatever that they are
hooked on continuing.  [All children under the age of 18 and even 12 ar good
targets to take advantage of if they have drug habbits.]  Tell your local pusher
that when he sells his goods that he should refer any young and fairly good
looking girls to you for some extra cash.  [They will jump at the offer.]
employer.  DO NOT TAE FREE SAMPLES!!  The girls will only feel intimidated. You
what he thought.

Could the girl do better?
Will she improve with practice?
Did she resest only in the beginning, or also later?
What is your total over-all feeling of her?
Can you spread the word around about my services?

Thank You...  See you again!

	Once that you have a clientell set-up and a good list of girls, have a
 Data-Base like Apple Works keep track of appointments and other things.  If you
 decide to continue with the bussiness, invest in Real Estate.	That will also
 pay-off in the end!  Open up a descrete Whore-House.

	This is NO joking matter, this is the exact thing that you should do.

	If you decide that drug pushing is a better money maker, then do it, but
 whatever you do, don't do what you sell.  It is allways better that you do not
 sample what you sell!!!  Allways remember this!  That was the down-fall of some
 friends that I knew that had a few bussiness like that of which we are refering
 to.

	The final thing that you should do, to keep your investment going, is to
 allways have the girls checked-up weekly.  You do not want any deseases going
 around.  That may hurt you reputation.

 Keep it clean, don't sample what you sell, and be curtios to the customer. If
 you follow what I have told you, you will be able to relax in luxury in just a
 year or less and afford anything that you want.  This is what we call capitol
 gain, something like Monopoly...

	Well, I think that the next best thing to being a pimp is a drug dealer
  This is a more dangerous way to make money because you are dealing with more
dangerous people.  To start it off, you must find your way to being a dealer
through other dealers.	You have to get contacts and find out where your local
dealer is getting his stash from.  I am not an expert on this subject but once
you get the connections all you have to do is be carefull of gready dealers that
do not want to share customers with you.  The best place to pass off a few drugs
the you have been stocking up on, is the good ole' PARTY!!!  This is the best
place that you can sell all kinds of things to everyone.  Don't be afraid of the
cops in just the average friday night party, they are only there when  they make
themselves noticable.  When you see a few cop cars drive up to the  house or
whatever, get rid of your stash if the situation looks real bad. Don't worry
about loosing a few bucks.  It is much better to loose a little illegal money
than it is to get cought with it and the dope.	If the party gets raided, and
they usually do, get the hell out of there via the back door leading into the
backyard.  You must not run right to the cops who are o in the front of the
place.  Get going to the neighbor's yard and keep going.

	The party is a very good place to make a few bucks when you have gotten
a supplyer.  Remember what I said about the first file...  Don't do what you
sell, it will only get you fucked-up.

     Here's the third part of a series. I think that I will start to write a
book on the subject.

     The best place to find victims are in incredibally crouded places someplace
like a concert or a movie the theater, someplace that is dark or something.  I
have found that the movies during everyone is leaving and bumping against
everybody.  I also like the Factory of Nightmares, a holloween festival.  The
only good concerts to hit are New-Wave, Pop or Jazz concerts because you don't
want to fuck with a bug ass punker that has 20 friends that can beat the shit
out of you.

     Once you have found a target (victim), approach him or her. Wallets are
easy prey and in my opinion, are much easier to get.  Besides, the male usually
carries more cash with him. Don't go for purses unless you have some sissors to
cut the strap connected to the purse (this makes it much easier.)  Well, if your
victim is male and carries a wallet, push him away from you while you are
holding on to his wallet.  Kinda fake that you bumped into him on accident;
well, you know. This way, he moved and his wallet didn't, it will still be in
your grimy little hands.  HA HA....  He won't even feel it.  If you are just
begining, quickly drop the wallet on the floor, and put your foot over it.  If
the man turns around, just say if he asks about it, "Ohhh, looky there... Is
this your wallet that just feel out of ya pocket? WOW what do you know!!"  You
will be off the hook.  Later, and have fun;
