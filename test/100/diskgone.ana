To get even with an ex trading friend. Offer to send him the newest
ware by mail. But before you do this take the disk out of its jacket
and do the following:

  Take a small dish and pour acetone (nail polish remover) into it.  Now get
lotsa matcheads and put them in it.  Now pulverize it until you have a somewhat
gooey consistency.  This is what you should brush on the disk in a thin layer
but make sure you leave a clean area to show thru the envelope.  Now when he
boots it, it boots him!!!
