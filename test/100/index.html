<H1>Jason Scott's Top 100 Textfiles</H1>
<P>
It's perfectly understandable that someone finding textfiles.com for the first
time wouldn't be interested in sifting through thousands of textfiles to get an
idea of what the site is about.  For this reason, I've selected a "best of"
collection of one hundred textfiles that I think capture the spirit of this site
and the unique culture that it attempts to preserve. <P>
While in many cases, there are slicker or longer examples of these files, I felt
that these specific examples best captured the genre they belonged to. I invite
you to browse through this section, read up, and if you find something that
intrigues you, to read more about it in the bulk of the site.
<P>
These files are arranged alphabetically, not in any order of importance.

A good portion of the "General" boards you see listed were in fact Phreak or Pirate boards. Keeping an active account on all your local systems could be quite time-consuming.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="actung.hum">actung.hum</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 332<BR><TD> <B>Relaxen und watch das blinkenlights...</B><BR><I>This sort of small, quaint humor file could be found lurking across many different kinds of BBSes and mainframes. Origin: Unknown, although it very likely could date back to the 60's or 70's.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="ad.txt">ad.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 1664<BR><TD> <B>Call The Upside Down BBS!</B><BR><I>A typical "Tag File" for a Bulletin Board System, in this case a classic Apple II with 64k of memory. To entice you over, the BBS offers you everything up to and including the two floppy disks located in the floppy drives. Besides being an interesting approach for a BBS ad, this short file also shows the variety of devices you could hook to an Apple II, including devices you could hook to other devices.</I><BR>&nbsp

This file is a solid example of a "Walk-through", where the goal was to present an easy, no-thinking solution to the classic thinking person's game: text adventures. While these games could present hours (or days or weeks) of fun trying to solve the puzzles and pitfalls, many people were content to just be given the answer and go through the game blindly, watching as every step they made was the exact right one. To a smaller degree, there was a constant one-upsmanship with Walkthroughs, where whoever could come out with the "solve" for a game the soonest after it was released (or even before) was the King of the Hill.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="angela.art">angela.art</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 6656<BR><TD> <B>ASCII Art of "Angela"</B><BR><I>A solid, classic example of an ASCII Nude, brimming with joy and text-based sexiness. Some of these were hand-drawn, while others used primitive digitizers and software that translated graphics to text to give surprisingly realistic photos when seen from a distance. Naturally, these files were a hot trade online.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="anonymit">anonymit</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 34657<BR><TD> <B>The Joy of Handles, by Mahatma Kane Jeeves and David Lescohier</B><BR><I>This series of articles attacks the issue of anonymity and handles from a completely different set of perspectives; that is, the protection of the writer from general harassment and investigation, and not necessarily that of promoting unwelcome or illegal ideas. An informative read.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="applemaf.hum">applemaf.hum</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 21388<BR><TD> <B>The Apple Mafia Story, as told to Red Ghost, 1986</B><BR><I>This interesting insight into the comings and goings of the Apple piracy world of the early-mid 80's shows the battle between the older class of pirates and the new breed of "r0dentz" that has been waged for the last 20 years. This file also gives a history (and hardware list) of the Sherwood Forest BBSes, which were among my all-time favorite boards, and probably a pretty darn influential force in the world that textfiles.com presents.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="apples.txt">apples.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 8960<BR><TD> <B>Typical Apple Piracy Message Base, circa 1984</B><BR><I>This pristine capture of a 14-message apple "warez" message base shows a gamut of user types converging in one place to trade boasts, information, and programs. From Sherlock Apple's boast of "I have em all!!!!!!" to Creative Cracker and Key Master's BBS ads, you can see how these places became hotbeds of activity and information. Key master and I traded textfiles back then; I thought nothing of calling a BBS called "The 4th Reich".</I><BR>&nbsp

(This file is incomplete for the moment, but you'll get the idea.)</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="b00g!.hum">b00g!.hum</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 6623<BR><TD> <B>B00g and the Art of Zen, by Anarchy Incorporated</B><BR><I>This file started a weird "b00g" craze that perpetuated itself for a number of years across a lot of BBSes that I was on/involved in. Then again, Anarchy Inc. was one of those groups you could depend on for some really excellent writing no matter what the subject was about.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="balls.txt">balls.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 2845<BR><TD> <B>Mouse Balls Available as a Field Replacement Unit</B><BR><I>A classic example of a somewhat plausible file making the rounds for years and years. This likely-true file discussing how to wash the balls from Computer Mice took on a life of its own and still shows up occasionally. Surely a giggle, if not a guffaw.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="basicom4.phk">basicom4.phk</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 17717<BR><TD> <B>Bioc Agent's Telecommunications Series, Part IV</B><BR><I>BIOC Agent 003 was one of those rare phone phreaks who could both assimilate information around him and present it in a well-written, forthright manner. Often, many of the phreaking textfiles of the time were poorly written, hastily formatted, and lacking in any perspective beyond how to break or get freebies from a computer or network. Bioc got a lot of attention with his clear writing and informative series "The Basics of Telecommunications", which appeared in the summer of 1984. This example from the series, part 4 (of 7) covered both the hierarchy and electronic network of the Bell Telephone System. Groundbreaking.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="basicom5.phk">basicom5.phk</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 18867<BR><TD> <B>Bioc Agent's Telecommunications Series, Part V</B><BR><I>Another example of BIOC's writing in the Basics of Telecommunications Series, this section dealt entirely with the basic telephone, including the wiring and the electronic aspects. Notably, BIOC gives a bibliography where he got a lot of his information (something pretty much not done beforehand) and additionally covers the theory of operation of the infamous "Black Box", as well. Excellent.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="bbsdeath.pro">bbsdeath.pro</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 7639<BR><TD> <B>Whatever Happened to REAL Bulletin-Board Systems?</B><BR><I>What strikes me about this file was that it was written around 1982 and decries how out-of-touch, vicious, and impersonal the BBS world has grown for the writer. Note the interesting reasons he gives for the downturn of BBS's.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="bc760mod.ham">bc760mod.ham</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 1408<BR><TD>  <B>Modification of the Uniden Bearcat BC950XLT for Cellular Frequencies, by John Stover (March 29, 1988)</B><BR><I>The problem was major: Cellular phones could be listened to by any ham radio scanner being made. The normal solution: Produce better cell phones, that did a better job of encrypting/scrambling transmissions. The solution the government took: Force all creators of any ham radio scanners to remove the capability of ham radios to listen to the frequencies chosen for the cellular phones. Naturally, the companies did this in the cheapest way possible, often just running a short-circuiting wire such that attempts to go to those frequencies would be unsuccessful. And naturally, files such as this one made themselves available, where you were told how to take out that wire and restore the machine to full functionality. Was the point to listen in on people? No. The point was crippling technology to hide things from people flies in the face of the spirit of technology. 5 short lines, and the efforts from the unknowing are thwarted. The power of textfiles.</I><BR>&nbsp

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="bhbb1.hac">bhbb1.hac</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 9837<BR><TD> <B>Better Homes and Blue Boxing, Part I, by Mark Tabas (January 7, 1985)</B><BR><I>Mark Tabas came along in 1985 and wrote a series of chatty, friendly files about all the fun you could have with the mysterious Blue Box, the most famous of all the Phreak Boxes that rose out of the 1970's and 1980's. This box, when used in conjunction with a 2600hz tone across a phone line, allowed you to seize control a telephone line as if you were an operator and do all sorts of neat, crazy stuff. By 1985 these boxes were becoming obsolete (with the advent of Electronic Switching System, or ESS) but this file harkens back to this interesting era. A sign of the great works LOD would create for the next decade.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="billrights.fun">billrights.fun</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 3746<BR><TD> <B>The Bill of Rights "Lite", by John Perry Barlow</B><BR><I>This re-tooled Bill of Rights, rephrased to reflect most of the constitutional issues arising in cyberspace and in general everyday life, hit the nail on the head as to how far the government had strayed from its original plan. Barlow, a co-founder of the Electronic Freedom Foundation, makes his beliefs about the modern world known in just a couple screenfuls of slashed-up constitutional law.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="black.box">black.box</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 4460<BR><TD> <B>To All Who Dare -- The Black Box</B><BR><I>For many people, this simple little text file was the opening door into the world of the Phone Phreak, a world where a simple application of technology meant a subversion of the great and powerful Bell System. In this case, the Black Box would convince the telephone company that your phone was still ringing, even though you'd picked the phone up and were chatting happily through the buzzing rings. With its name owing to the 1970's era "Blue Box", the Black Box was the final spark to ignite a stream of steady "box" files, each one a more flamboyant and wild color and each promising the world.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="bofh.1">bofh.1</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 3854<BR><TD> <B>The Bastard Operator From Hell #1, by Simon Travaglia</B><BR><I>As the BBS kids of the world grew into full-fledged System Operators, they found that no textfile out there caught the frustrations and issues of a computer hacker saddled with responsibility more than the BOFH (Bastard Operator from Hell) series. Stretching through many files and continuing to this day as a magazine column, these textfiles set out an alternate-world Simon the Sysadmin who would torture and ruin his users in the pursuit of more free time and lager. The initials BOFH have become one of the better-kept inside jokes of the System Admin trade, and these files have become immortal.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="cDc-0200.txt">cDc-0200.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 124155<BR><TD> <B>The cDc #200 Higgledy-Piggledy-Big-Fat-Henacious-Mega-Mackadocious You-Can't-Even-Come-Close-So-Jump-Back-K-BOOMIDY-BOOMIDY-BOOM File, by Swamp Ratte'</B><BR><I>The Cult of the Dead Cow continues to be a prominent force in the online world, but when they started in the late 1980's they were just another text-file writing group, copying heavy metal lyrics and printing bomb ingredient lists. Swamp Ratte's perseverance and leadership caused cDc to break out of that mode, however, and by the time they'd released their 200th textfile (In December of 1992) they'd been around for over 6 years, forever by BBS standards. To celebrate, Swamp Ratte' wrote this file, which I consider to be an all-time classic not only because of the dead-on parodies of the BBS world of the 1980's that run through it, but for the way these parodies perfectly capture a lot of the cultural forces that ran through that time. (The warez vs. textfiles debate, the self-aggrandizement of older hackers, the completely bizzare spelling styles, etc.) This file truly goes above and beyond in every way. A great reference file to see if you can get all the jokes when reading other files here.</I><BR>&nbsp

In a few short paragraphs, Steven Wozniak describes Phone Phreaking with an innocent sense of fun and exploration, using common technology. </I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="captmidn.txt">captmidn.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 24394<BR><TD> <B>The Story of Captain Midnight</B><BR><I>This textfile, source unknown, tells the story of Captain Midnight, a lone satellite operator who overrode HBO's signal with a warning against charging $12.95 a month and scrambling their signal. This sudden seizure of the HBO signal caught the media (and the government)'s attention, and he was soon caught. This textfile saves the memory of a fellow who took matters into his own hands, and blew out a showing of Pee Wee's Big Adventure as a bonus. </I><BR>&nbsp

Built simply to be a flexible modem, this piece of technology contained 4 digital to analogue converters and several other unexpected ports and switches that caused it to be used as a clock, answering machine/voice mailbox, hold button, voice changer, and music player. Simply put, this modem was beyond belief. This textfile helps show some of the amazing modifications to this modem that were devised by its users. </I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="codegeek.txt">codegeek.txt</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 20841<BR><TD> <B>Robert Hayden's Code of the Geeks v1.01</B><BR><I>The Geek Code is one of those bizzare Internet-only phenomenons that would only rise up among a culture dominated by the intelligensia: a code that, through an application of letters with plus or minus modifications, would indicate the hobbies, desires, or public aspects of that person, easily machine-readable, but to anyone who didn't know the code, completely indecipherable. </I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="copyprot.pro">copyprot.pro</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 11392<BR><TD> <B>Copy Protection: A History and Outlook</B><BR><I>Dt writes a quick overview (intended for publication, and therefore a little more balanced than it normally would have been) about the history of copy protection and some of the methods used on both sides in the war over software. </I><BR>&nbsp

A speech given at the Future of Freedom Conference that is at once balanced, intruiging, revolutionary, bitter, hopeful, and inspiring. All around, ahead of its time and relevant to this very minute.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="dec.wars">dec.wars</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 31839<BR><TD> <B>DEC WARS: The Continuing Saga of the Adventures of Luke Vaxhacker</B><BR><I>One of the earlier and one of the best cross-cultural fan fiction files, combining the world of Digital's VAX series of computers with the Star Wars movies. Peppered throughout this file, tons of inside VAX jokes combine with Star Wars references, making it one of the geekiest, nerdiest files you could come across online. This genre has exploded out of control since then, but at the time, it was something really new, and a ton of fun.</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="diskgone.ana">diskgone.ana</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 627<BR><TD> <B>When He Boots It, It Boots Him! From Ziggy Stardust</B><BR><I>This explosive device sticks in the mind because of both the pure nastiness of the situation (booby trapping a floppy disk to turn it into a bomb) and the reason given for a person to risk someone else's life: they didn't trade pirated programs honestly.<BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="dodontae.hum">dodontae.hum</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 9385<BR><TD> <B>The Do's and Don'ts of Ascii Express, by Quasimoto</B><BR><I>The story of Ascii Express is one of a telecommunications company adding a small feature to allow remote downloads, that spread into a massive underground network of pirated applications throughout the Apple II community. These "AE Lines" provided quick, simple access to other floppy drives across the country, and became a subculture all their own. This file purports to give some suggested etiquette for AE lines, only to be deflated quite humorously by Count Nibble at the end.<BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="easymony.ana">easymony.ana</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 6709<BR><TD> <B>A Guide to Easy Money, by The Flash (January 4, 1986)</B><BR><I>Even a cursory read of this file shows that the Flash knew not one molecule of what he was talking about. This complete lack of knowledge in the dark arts of Street Economy obviously didn't stop him from publishing a series of files on how to succeed in them. At this no-man's land between fact and fantasy, you get a great insight into the author's idea of how the world works, and how easy he thought the world of crime was. (Ostensibly, the Flash has gone on to a nice, quiet life somewhere.)<BR>&nbsp

Somehow, I can imagine this happening. And oh, he's the MANAGER! While a lot of drug files tend to be boring chemical lists or long and drawn-out philosophical discussions, this file makes you think twice about who's working the cash register.</I><BR>&nbsp

No doubt in the years after his break away from life on the modem he's built even more circles of friends, but one can't help wondering if he doesn't read this file and think of what else he threw away besides his collection of "warez".</I><BR>&nbsp
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="elite.cmd">elite.cmd</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 5946<BR><TD> <B>The Elite Commandments</B><BR><I>As the word "Elite" came to be bandied about in BBSes, people started to separate themselves between the "Elite" and "Unelite". Specifically, this was just another way to look down on others based on completely arbitrary, meaningless reasons. This file skewers that attitude in a list of "commandments" that best represent the mindset of the self-named "elite". As a bonus, several inside jokes from the era are presented in a "gossip weekly" parody at the end.</I><BR>&nbsp

This file was part of a trend of Sysops explaining to users how great they had it for having BBSes to call, and to appreciate the work behind them. They were rarely successful, but you do what you can. The invitation to download the file and display it on other BBSes meant that some new users would be subjected to this file automatically. The "wearing a tie to school" side of the BBS world.</I><BR>&nbsp

Some of them, such as a probe suddenly losing contact with earth, are scarily sobering, but others, such as the Multics bug (the swapper-out process would swap out the swapper-in process!) make you just want to snort, assuming you snort at that sort of thing. Geeky, and cute.</I><BR>&nbsp

In the case of FEH, indicative of the textfiles of the time, it is sometimes very hard to tell where the parody and where the seriousness lay within the issue. While a lot of it seems to be a thought-out send-up of the badly-spelling hacking community, some serious and researched information is included as well. This magazine went on to several additional issues, each of them a little more serious than the last. For better or worse, this is how things came to be in the culture.</I><BR>&nbsp

This file caught my attention because he chose a subject that would normally be of very little interest to the BBS crowd (Gemology) and takes it to a completely new level by turning it into both a wonderful history lesson about Gems (I learned a lot in this file) and twisting it into yet another way to scam the planet for some extra bucks. Breathtaking in his audacity, and completely slick in his delivery. One to watch.</I><BR>&nbsp

Often the story is hard to track back, and is even more often a paraphrase of what actually happened, but it never fails to be humorous, especially if it lasted this far. A classic "urban legend", even if it's true.</I><BR>&nbsp

While the information in these texts might not be as relevant, this introduction stands apart for its preaching the idea of hacking for knowledge, and leaving no footprints and destroying nothing in the process. Their definition of "Hacker" is rather interesting, as well. A clever set of files.</I><BR>&nbsp

He does a very admirable job. While no book (so far) has captured the 1980's computer hacker experience perfectly, this book makes you come away with a feeling that the major issues were touched on and that no-one (on either side) got the short shaft. (This is a major accomplishment in itself.) Sterling is an excellent writer, and while compared to other works in this directory this textfile is a bit on the mammoth side, it's worth it. This file also highlights the work of the great Project Gutenberg, which for 20 years has endeavored to transcribe as many classic works to electronic texts as their staff of volunteers will let them. There's an entire directory of these important and breathtakingly huge projects on textfiles.</I><BR>&nbsp

For some reason, this file became the flashpoint that a number of books (including Bruce Sterling's) used as an example of the oppression of the intelligent and the motivations behind the fine art of hacking. Whether it stands up to this sort of light or not, it's a clear statement from someone who feels a lot of pain; and that's what communication is all about.</I><BR>&nbsp

This indicates not a little leaning on the side of the groups he's analyzing. He goes over impressions that the media have about hackers, what being a hacker, phreak or pirate consists of as he sees it, and then tries to draw conclusions of what this all means.

A prime example are these Legion of Doom/Hacker Technical journals, an indirect response to Phrack and other hacker magazines. The LOD/H Tech Journal was heavy, meaty stuff for the time (1987) with schematics, statistics, and even attributions to the files that had come before it.

(Actually, Iskra then came back and became the SysOp of the most recent incarnations of the Works, so it's all kind of circular in a way.) In any event, they got their heads together in the early 1990's and wrote this file, a parody of the "Dick and Jane" books that my generation lightly heard of. Short, sweet, and funny. Oh, and political. </I><BR>&nbsp

Now, looking back over the years with a more solid technical knowledge, some of the claims in this BBS information file are questionable (It's a modular program? What does that matter!) But you can see an example of how technology presented its own inherent sexiness to the BBS user.</I><BR>&nbsp

Psychoe's tale of murder, sexual mayhem, the Lord of Darkness and overactive babysitters never fails to floor me with its perfect blend of comic rant and erotic literature. You come away from reading it completely dazed and unsure what you just read. While you begin to read the file thinking you're to be subjected to another set of poorly spelled pseudo-erotic scribblings, you quickly realize as the character dies that something is quite amiss. After a short time you can't keep track of who is who and why the poor guy keeps getting lit on fire. Another great example of the Heavy Metal/Geek combination that showed up in a small number of AE lines in the 80's. </I><BR>&nbsp

If you print it out so that it's black letters on a white background, it looks pretty darn impressive. Of course, actually printing it out and putting it on a wall would immediately tap you as a geek, so be careful, and have a shredder at hand.</I><BR>&nbsp

The exact tone of this missive is a little hard to track: in some places he's nostalgic and out of sorts about the way the world has changed, and in others he's the first to the forefront of implementing clampdowns of security and creating traps for any hapless hackers attacking his BBS. Definitely makes you think, if not too hard.</I><BR>&nbsp

With their unique blend of Heavy Metal, Satanism, and Geek Chic, the group put out some of the odder files out there. In the case of this file, The Blade tells you how to drive others to self-destruction, so as to make it easier to get into college or a well-paying job.  A graphic collection of sick suggestions; just the soft of thing you could expect from this group. Are people really afraid of this sort of thing?</I><BR>&nbsp

This soft of file, meant to be a light parody of another, more famous work, ends up standing up pretty well on its own. There's one for documentation as well, and there's other more pop-culture books expounding on the Tao you can purchase these days. A good read if you believe in it or you don't.</I><BR>&nbsp

In this particular rag, a hapless user named Jeff Spicolli is subject to implications of incest, lack of technical knowledge, bestiality, and other similar traits, ending with his voice telephone number. This type of file would start showing up on local AE lines or BBSes and while most of these rants would disappear about a week or two after the Sysops took them down, a few still hung around. The most involved set of rag files to my knowledge would be the Matt Ackeret chronicles from Anarchy Incorporated. </I><BR>&nbsp

Reading over the commandments, we find that the SysOp is God, that you must not use handles or speak of things not involving computers, that profanity is unwelcome, and that a full three commandments dictate what kind of advertising you may post. This file is a great example of how attitude could turn a BBS from a place of fun to a stuffed-shirt, bland, unenjoyable piece of cardboard. Then again, posting this kind of file told people what kind of administrator you were right off the bat, enabling easy and quick escape. Run. </I><BR>&nbsp

In the course of an investigation, the US Secret Service raided Steve Jackson games and confiscated all the materials of a role-playing game called GURPS CYBERPUNK, which was played with dice and cards, and didn't even involve a computer. SJ Games were unable to have their game back for 7 months, during which time it was described as some sort of "hacking manual" that the country had to be protected from. Naturally, when all was said and done, the game was harmless and nothing what the Secret Service claimed it was. A true insight into ignorance on a massive scale. </I><BR>&nbsp

Spafford</B><BR><I>The Internet Worm changed a lot of minds about how interconnected and insecure the Internet was at that time. Using a combination of weaknesses and back doors in common  programs, the Worm wended its way throughout the then-small Net and succeeded in crippling it. This document, written during the Aftermath, presents a well-thought-out analysis of all the methodology used by the worm, as well as a general oversight of the state of the Internet of the time. Long, but worth it.</I><BR>&nbsp

What possible use this knowledge could have in one's day to day existence is pretty darn irrelevant; the point was, it was THERE, we WANTED TO KNOW, and Nibble FOUND IT OUT. That's the spirit of learning. Read and find out too.</I><BR>&nbsp

As might be expected, parodies began appearing, including the "Blotto Box" (which would supposedly destroy an entire telephone central switching office) and this specimen, which purports to cause the headset on the other end of the line to injure or kill the user. Naturally, this file is complete fiction, but constructed with enough of a straight face to make the unsuspecting collector think they have some sort of accurate textfile. An excellent awareness test.</I><BR>&nbsp

One result of this was that you always had a surprise the next time you connected to the BBS, and you always felt like you were part of a party. Note that the system actually made me type in my password, only to ignore me and continue its merry blather for a few more paragraphs.</I><BR>&nbsp

Through his sad tale of VAX abuse, Mike keeps you interested to the very end. How much of it is true is left up to the reader, of course, but somehow, it just rings enough with me to consider it real. Interesting.</I><BR>&nbsp

With Random Senseless Violence, by Count Nibble (August 2, 1985)</B><BR><I>Count Nibble was one of the most literate of all the Apple II-era textfile writers, pre-dating similarly styled groups like Metal Communications and the Cult of the Dead Cow by years with his musical quotes, proper spelling and formatting, and choosing all sorts of esoteric subjects to write about. In the case of this file, he lists out his suggestions for causing mayhem and destruction on a boring summer's night. Through browsing his web presence, an interesting fact about Nibble made itself known to me: He was college-age when this and other files were written, bringing a maturity to both his spelling and general perspective, if not his general outlook on personal property. A pioneer.</I><BR>&nbsp

In the vernacular of the Internet, this has come to be known as a "flame war", but the same idea holds: Long after the intended subject has dropped out of debate, two (or more) sides begin a verbal assault on each other that fills the message base with dozens of personal attacks, insinuations, libel, and slander. After a while, everyone not personally involved in the bitchwar is driven away, posting messages on other sub-boards, which causes them to be insulted for not posting on the right sub-board, possibly leading to another bitchwar. Barney Badass, himself, was a true character and the instigator of some of my finest on-line memories.</I><BR>&nbsp

The attempt to parody industrial labelling as well as the attention to clever turns of phrase marks a lot of the "big iron" humor in textfiles from professionals and college students of this time, showing they were looking for a little lightness in their otherwise stressful and highly-taxing occupations.</I><BR>&nbsp

Most noticeably, his automatic dismissal of anyone asking "how do I do this?" on public boards shows the beginnings of a trend that continues to this day. (Note also, that his portrait of the most trustable phreakers/hackers are anyone jewish, middle-upper-class, and under 19.)</I><BR>&nbsp

This file came out of my mind one summer in my 16th year while I was home sick with the flu. As my BBS was dedicated to textfiles, I thought it would be fun to write one of my own about why textfiles were better. This file was parodied by a few of my friends at the time, but I think, looking back, my heart was in the right place. (It's still there.)</I><BR>&nbsp

In the case of Phone Phreaks and later Phreak Magazines, this foundation was YIPL, the house organ of the Yippies, who were a revolutionary youth group of the 1960's. YIPL provided one of the first radical magazines dedicated to learning more about technology. While the first issues (under the influence of Abbie Hoffman and others) merely called upon its readers to use this knowledge as a crowbar to smash the state, later issues (when the magazine renamed itself to the Technological Assistance Party, or TAP) brought forth a love of learning and understanding how technology affected all our lives, and a need to know who was pulling the strings. BIOC does his best to transcribe this issue as close to what it looked like when hastily-scrawled copies were sent out to a few dozen people in June of 1971. Good show.</I>
