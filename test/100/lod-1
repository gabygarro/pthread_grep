                               INTRODUCTION:


               Welcome to the premiere issue of the LOD/H TJ!

     The LOD/H TJ is a soft-copy free newsletter whose primary purpose is to
further the knowledge of those who are interested in topics such as:
Telecommunications, Datacommunications, Computer & Physical Security/Insecurity
and the various technical aspects of the phone system.

     The articles contained herein, are totally original unless otherwise
stated. All sources of information for a specific article is listed in the
introduction or conclusion of the atricle. We will not accept any articles that
are unoriginal, plagiarized, or contain invalid or false information. Articles
will be accepted from anyone who meets those criteria. We are not dependant
upon readers for articles, since members of LOD/H and a select group of others
will be the primary contributers, but anyone can submit articles.

     Readers are encouraged to download all files for each issue, not just the
ones they are interested in. The reason for this is twofold: The newsletter
was designed to be a group effort, and the files herein were not intended for
individual distribution, and secondly, keeping the issue intact allows you to
distribute it to other BBS's and phriends who are interested in it.

     There is no set date for releasing issues, as we have no monetary or legal
obligation to the readers, but we predict subsequent issues will be released
between 2 and 3 months from the previous one. Thus, expect 4 to 6 issues a year
assuming we continue to produce them, which we intend to do.

     Newsletter sponsors are boards which will get the newsletter directly from
the staff as soon as it is released, and has added our 'staff account' to the
userlist in order for the readers to respond directly to us about the content
of the newsletter. If your board would like to become a sponsor, leave us mail
on any of the following sponsors boards:

     An LOD/H TJ staff account is on all our sponsor BBS's. This allows readers
to get in contact with us for the following reasons:

* If you have questions about any article, or question the validity of the
  material, you are welcome to contact us through the staff account and leave
  a way for the author to contact you. This insures a better understanding from
  the readers of the topic and also, insures the integrity of the author as far
  as knowledge and originality of the topic is concerned.

* You may leave questions for the staff which will be answered in our 'Ask the
  Staff' section of the newsletter. The questions selected will be of general
  interest to others. Any questions not published will try to be answered via
  E-Mail. We don't know everything, but anything we do know will be shared
  with those who ask.

     Various features of the newsletter include:

Editorials: These will feature short articles on topics which affect the
            telecom world in general.

Network News & Notes: News articles and other things of interest pertaining to
                      the things this newsletter specializes in.

Reader Mail: Questions and comments about previous issues from readers who
             contact us through our staff account on sponsor boards.

Special Features: These will pop up from time to time and can be anything which
                  does not fit in the general format of the newsletter.

                    Custom Local Area Signalling Services

                         Written by: The Videosmith

                               Version - 1.1

 ----------------------------(c) Copyright 1994---------------------------

 This article will explain the newly developed LASS system (AT&T Bell Labs),
 and how it may affect us in the near future. Note that the service as it
 appears for customers is called "CLASS", the C standing for Custom. I
 assume this is just for looks.

 LASS
 ----

    The telephone was destined to become a well used and powerful tool for
 otherwise tedious tasks. Gas meters and other metered services would be
 surveyed through the use of automatic data retrieval employing telephone
 communications. All in all, some have big plans for the uses one could put
 the telephone system up to, and CLASS is one plan that is going to drop
 an innovative bombshell on the telecommunicating world.

    At this moment, a local CCIS network feature is being developed by
 Bell Laboratories. This feature will change the way people use fones, and
 will also change the attitude in which they use them. It will give far
 more control of the telephone to the user than ever before. This feature
 is called CLASS (Custom Local Area Signalling Services).

    Everyone will find something useful in this newly developed telephone
 feature. Pizza parlours will no longer have to worry about fraudulent italian
 food mongers, and little old ladies won't have to worry about prank calls
 by certain dubious characters.

    What are all these fantastic features?  These features will
 include call back of the last caller, regardless of whether you have their
 telephone number or not. Another will be distinct call waiting tones, and
 preselected call forwarding (only those people whom you wish to speak to
 will be forwarded). This is a rudimentary list of CLASS features to come.
 It is a very powerful system, and it all relys on LCCIS (Local Common
 Channel Interoffice Signalling), an intra-LATA version of the ever-popular
 CCIS.

 CCIS Background
 ---------------

    CCIS was originally introduced in 1976 as, basically, the signalling
 system to end all signalling systems. Instead of using the voice grade
 trunks to carry signalling information on, a data network would be used. This
 network is comprised of data links from each TO [involved with CCIS] to
 the appropriate STP (signal transfer point). Signalling information is sent
 through these links at 4800 bps to the STPs (Note that baud rates may increase
 due to the economic availability of faster data communications hardware),
 where stored program control routes the signalling information to the needed
 offices in order to open and complete the call path. SPC checks automatically
 for on-hook/off-hook status before opening the path, and if the status is
 off-hook (in this case the customer does not have the call waiting custom
 calling feature), returns information to the originating CO to apply a busy
 signal to the customer. This is but one of many features toll CCIS provides
 the network with.

    Since this text is not centered on the topic of toll CCIS, technical
 aspects aren't as important (except for the comparison between the local
 and toll networks for observational purposes): yet it is important to
 notice how automated and flexible this type of signalling method is, as well
 as its speed and efficiency. All the software control involved with local
 and toll networks is called, fittingly, the "stored program control network."
 or ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network). LCCIS will be addressed in a
 future article.

 CLASS/LCCIS Features
 --------------------

 LCCIS would look like this:



                                   /--X
                                   CO-2

                   /--X--LCCIS--|CCIS/SPC|--LCCIS--/--X
                   CO-1         ----------         CO-3
                   ESS#                            ESS#
                   -1A----interoffice trunk group---1A-
NPA - Dial 1223           213 NPA (GTE) - Dial 114

 SPC = Stored Program Control (Network control and Signal Transfer Point)
 ITG = Interoffice Trunk Group

    Using a high-speed data link between local offices creates a much more
 flexible and more effecient way for intra-LATA central offices to communi-
 cate. Instead of using per-trunk signalling (using the same trunk used for
 voice transmission to send routing and billing information), such data would
 be sent thru a 2400 bps dedicated data link, which interacts with a local
 signal processing and transfer point. From that point, signalling information
 is distributed to appropriate central offices or tandem switches.

    At the during which this article was being initially researched, CLASS was
    only being developed for the #1A ESS switch due to the flexibility of it's
 memory handling, it's speed and what Bell Labs called 'cost efficiency'. At
 the end of the research involved with this article, CLASS was already
 implemented in data stage on ESS#5.

    LCCIS will work with the local switches using stored program con-
 trol, keeping track of call data. The 1A switches will use what
 is called "scratch pad" memory (also known as call store), in conjuction
 with LCCIS's database, to accomplish all the features that LASS provides.
 This memory will hold such data as "line history", and a "screening list".
 That information will make it possible for autoredial, selective call
 forwarding, nuisance call rejection, and distinctive call waiting tones.

 Selective CF
 ------------

    Selective call forwarding is defined by the subscriber (the sub-
 scriber must have conventional call forwarding to request this service).
 Using call store, or more specifically the screening list, one will
 be able to selectively forward a call to another directory number by
 executing a few simple commands on the friendly home-bound telephone
 (unlike migrating telephones most frequently found in hotel rooms). An
 access code (a list will appear at the end of the file) will be entered,
 and a special tone will be issued from the subscriber's CO. The cus-
 tomer will then dial in the numbers he wants forwarded to the particular
 number. After each number, a tone will sound indicating the acceptance
 of the number. Individual BOC's (Bell Operating Companies) will be
 able to define the amount of numbers which may be screened. Once this is
 done, the cusomter hangs up and the ESS takes over. Now, whenever some
 one calls this particular customer, the customer's switch will compare
 the calling line's directory number with those stored in scratch pad
 memory. If the CLID matches one of the numbers in 1A memory associated with
 the called directory number, the number is forwarded. If not, the phone will
 ring at the original destination. This in particular could make it very
 difficult on system hackers, as you could probably imagine. A company can
 subscribe to this CLASS feature, and enter only the numbers of authorized
 users to be forwarded to a computer. Bureaus inside the various telephone
 companies and other sensitive operations can screen calls to particular
 numbers by using this service.

    This is a security that's hard to beat, but of course there is a way
 (simple law of nature: nothing is fail-safe). There will always be the
 obvious way of finding numbers which are being forwarded to, like auto-
 dialing entire exchanges (one after the other). Unfortunetly, CLASS will
 be providing other services which might make "scanning" seem less
 attractive.

 Distinctive Ringing
 -------------------

    Distinctive ringing is handled in the same fashion as selective call
 forwarding is: the screen list in scratch pad memory. The customer may
 enter numbers which the ESS should give special precedence to, and when-
 ever a call is placed to this particular customer's number, ESS checks
 to see whether the CLID matches a directory number listed in the
 switch's memory. If a match is made, the subscriber's CO gives the off-hook
 line a special call waiting tone, or the on-hook phone a distinctive ring
 (possibly using abnormally timed ringing voltage... some readers may picture
 a British Telecom ring as an example, although many foreign audible rings
 tend to be different).

 Call Rejection
 --------------

    Nuisance call rejection, a feature making it possible to block certain
 idiots from ringing your fone (a feature we can all benefit from at
 one time or another... or all the time), uses the information retrieved
 from LCCIS (CLID).  Let's say customer A calls customer B:

                               ----LCCIS----
                     A ---> CO<             >CO ---> B
                               ----trunk----

    Customer B happens to despise customer A, and keys in a special *##
 code. ESS again takes over and looks at the CLID information, and stores
 the calling line directory number in a special screen list associated with
 with customer B. The next time customer A tries calling customer B, the
 terminating office will reroute the call to a local (the originating CO)
 digitized recording telling customer A that the call he made cannot be
 completed due to customer B's request ("I'm sorry, but the customer you
 have tried to reach wishes you were eaten by a rabid canibal on drugs").

 Dial Back
 ---------

    To create such a feature as "dial back" (for called or calling party),
 the ESS scratch pad memory is used again. The same principles are
 used as are employed in the already established custom calling feature,
 auto-redial. CLID will be used in this way:

                                     (received from CLID)
                   last-called-mem     last-caller-mem
                      ----------          ----------
                      |###-####|          |###-####|
                      ----------          ----------

    Your ESS switch will keep track of who you called last, and who called
 you last, thru the retrieval of calling line information provided by
 LCCIS in conjunction with your switch (Your switch will know what number
 you called last by directly storing the digits you dialed previously. Local
 signalling will provide calling line information via LCCIS call
 information forwarding using the data link mentioned). This way, with your
 access code (*##), you will have total re-dial service.

 Customer Trace
 --------------

    This type of memory handling and signalling method will also allow the
 feature that everyone was afraid would abolish "phreaking". Subscriber
 initiated tracing, using the last caller directory number stored at your CO,
 will be available as far as Bell Laboratories is concerned. There seems to be
 two types of "customer originated trace". One will forward the number to local
 authorities, at  which it will be handled through the police. The other
 feature AT&T/Bell Labs is working on will be a display module that will sit by
 your fone, and will display calling directory numbers. All other CLASS
 features that use the calling line information are used at the descretion of
 the caller. The customer originated trace, however, using the individual or
 bulk calling line identification features ("trace") allow the customer to view
 the calling number. The world is not ending... yet, in any case. Individual
 customers will be able to employ a special "privacy code", which when dialed,
 tells the far-end switch not to forward the calling number to a desk display.
 Whether there will be a way to override this or not is obvious: of course.
 The police, the military and government agencies are all likely to have a
 higher priority level than your privacy. It seems that long distance
 carriers could benefit greatly from CLASS. Why Bell/AT&T should give any type
 of special services to OCCs not given to other non-telephone companies,
 especially after equal access is fully implemented, I don't know (but then
 again, it is EQUAL access). It's always possible. It is also possible that
 there will be no desk display. There are those phone phreaks who feel that
 BOC's will never give the end party the priviledge of retrieving the calling
 party's number directly, if not due to plain old Bell policy on the issue of
 privacy. We'll have to wait and see about that point: the desk display is, in
 fact, operational and is being used in test stage. Whether Bell Labs feels
 that this feature can and will be used in a full scale non-beta stage BOC
 situation is a different story. The economic feasability is questionable.

 End Notes
 ---------

    CLASS, using local CCIS, will not function on inter-LATA calls. The
 local CCIS network is exactly that: local, and does not extend into the
 realm of "toll network". This will eventually be corrected (allowing toll
 CCIS to interact with LCCIS as far as CLID information is concerned). How
 the various long distance networks will exchange information with the local
 BOC network has not been determined [by the writer of this article]. It
 would seem like a monumental task to try to integrate the emerging long
 distance companies into the AT&T/BOC ISDN, be it because of equipment
 inconsistancies or lack of cooperation on the part of the OCC, etc. This
 will be discussed in an upcoming article dealing with toll CCIS.
 Although CLASS has been built around the ESS #1A switch, it has, as has been
 mentioned, been co-developed for use with the ESS #5 switching machine.

    CLASS is going to cause problems, as well as create a new environment
 for telephone users. Of course, those problems are only problems to people
 who will generally be reading this article, but the more you know about CLASS
 the more comfortable you'll feel about the service. It can be used to
 one's advantage, even as a telecommunications hobbyist. Just as a
 corporation will be able to set up a complete history of who is calling their
 system, and eventually keep people off the system using the screen list in
 memory, the same features can be applied to bulletin board systems and the
 like. Imagine being able to keep all the local bozos off your board, or
 being able to screen all but your private local users (making your system
 completely inaccessible through the PSTN network from any telephone but
 that of one of your users). It would seem to be a useful feature, if nothing
 else but an easy feature, to implement.

    It is a little difficult, if not plain awkward, to write an article about
 a topic which is subject to change at the researcher's ignorance. I think
 that CLASS is enough of a momentous issue that at least some text by a
 hobbyist should be released for public knowledge purposes.  Yet my awareness
 of the fact that some of this text may be outdated, or inaccurate, by the
 time CLASS is released as a BOC service, is in itself the explanation of why
 there is a version number at the head of this article. Most likely, when CLASS
 becomes public, the second version will be released with update notes
 (if need be...most probably so). I hope you enjoyed it,

The LOD/H Technical Journal: File #3 of 12


             Lex Luthor and The Legion Of Doom/Hackers Present:

             Identifying, Attacking, Defeating,  and Bypassing
             Physical Security and Intrusion Detection Systems

                           PART I: THE PERIMETER


The reasons for writing this article are twofold:

1) To prevent  the detection  and/or capture  of various  phreaks, hackers  and
   others,  who attempt to gain access to: phone company central offices, phone
   closets, corporate offices, trash dumpsters, and the like.

2) To create an awareness and  prove to various security managers, guards,  and
   consultants  how easy it  is to defeat  their security systems  due to their
   lack of planning, ignorance, and just plain stupidity.


In  the past, I have written  articles on "Attacking, Defeating, and Bypassing"
Computer Security.  Now I  take those  techniques and  apply them  to  Physical
Security.  The information  contained herein,  has been  obtained from research
on the different devices  used in physical security,  and in practical  "tests"
which I and others have performed on these devices.


INTRODUCTION:
-------------

Physical  Security  relies  on  the  following  ideas  to  protect  a facility:
Deterrence, Prevention, Detection, and Response. Deterrents are used to 'scare'
the  intruder  out of  trying  to gain  access.  Prevention tries  to  stop the
intruder from gaining access. Detection 'sees' the intruder while attempting to
gain  access. Response tries to stop and/or prevent as much damage or access to
a facility as  possible after detection.  There are 3  security levels used  in
this  article and in  industry to designate  a facility's need.  They are: Low,
Medium, and High. The amount, and types of security devices used by a  facility
are  directly proportional  to the level  of security the  facility 'thinks' it
needs. When  I  use  'facility' I  am  refering  to the  people  in  charge  of
security,  and the actual building and assets  they are trying to protect. This
article will be  primarily concerned with  the protection of  the perimeter.  I
have  2  other articles  planned in  this  series. The  second is  the security
concerning the exterior of a facility: cipher locks, window breakage detectors,
magnetic  contact switches, etc. The third part will deal with security systems
inside a facility: Passive Infra-Red detectors, ultrasonic detectors,  interior
microwave systems, and the various card access control systems.

THE PERIMETER:
--------------

A facility's first  line of defense  against intrusion is  its' perimeter.  The
perimeter may have any or all of the following:

* A single fence

* An interior fence coupled with an exterior fence

* Regular barbed wire

* Rolled barbed wire

* Various fence mounted noise or vibration sensors

* Security lighting and CCTV

* Buried seismic sensors and different photoelectric and microwave systems


Fences:
-------

Fences are commonly used to protect the perimeter. The most common fence in use
today is the cyclone fence,  better known as the  chain link fence. Fences  are
used  as a deterrent and to prevent  passage through the perimeter. Common ways
of defeating  fences are  by cutting,  climbing, and  lifting. Cutting  is  not
usually  recommended for surreptitious entry, since it is easily noticeable. In
this article,  we will  be  taking the  'Stealth'  approach. Climbing  is  most
commonly done, but if the fence is in plain view, it may not be advisable since
you can be seen easily. The higher the fence, the longer it takes to climb. The
longer it takes to climb, the longer security has to detect and respond to your
actions. Lifting is  better since  you are  closer to  the ground,  and not  as
easily  spotted, but the fence must be very  flexible, or the sand very soft so
you can get under  the fence quickly  and easily. Whenever  you see a  somewhat
'unclimbable' fence (or one that you just don't want to climb) you should check
the perimeter for  large trees with  uncut branches hanging  over the fence  or
other  objects which will enable you to  bypass the fence without ever touching
it. You  could use  a  ladder but  you don't  want  to leave  anything  behind,
especially  with your fingerprints on  it, not that you  plan on doing anything
illegal of course.

Electric fences are not used for security purposes as much as they were in  the
past.  Today, its  main use  if to keep  cattle or other animals  away from the
perimeter (either from  the inside or  outside). There are  devices which  send
a low voltage current through a fence and can detect a drop in the voltage when
someone grabs onto the fence. Again, not too common so I will not go into it.

For high security installations, there may be 2 fences. An outer fence, and  an
inner  fence which are 5-10 yards apart. It  isn't often that you see this type
of setup, it is mainly  used by government agencies  and the military. You  can
be  very sure that there are various intrusion detection devices mounted on the
fence, buried  underground  between  them, and/or  line-of-sight  microwave  or
photoelectric  devices used.  These will be  mentioned later. If  you insist on
penetrating the perimeter, then you should try to measure how far it is between
fences. Now find a 2 foot by X foot board where X is the distance between the 2
fences. Very slowly  place the board  on top of  both fences. If  there are  no
fence vibration sensors you can just climb the fence and step onto the board to
walk across the top. If there are  fence sensors, you will need a ladder  which
cannot touch the fence to get you on top of the board. You can then walk on the
board, over the ground in between, and jump down, being careful not to  disturb
the  fences. This will work if there are no sensors after the 2 fences. Identi-
fying sensors will  be mentioned later.  Obviously the method  of using a  long
board  to put on top of  the two fences will not  work if the fences are spaced
too far apart. Also, you and the board can be seen very easily.

Barbed Wire:
------------

There  are two common  types of barbed wire  in use today.  The more common and
less secure is the type that is strung horizontally across the fence with three
or more rows. The 'barbs' are spaced about 6" apart, enough for you to put your
hand in between while  climbing over. Also,  it is thin enough  to be cut  very
easily.  If you think you will need to leave in a hurry or plan on problem free
surreptitious entry and the only way out will be to climb over the fence  again
you  can cut the  wire from one post  to another, assuming the  wire is tied or
soldered to each post, and replace it with a plastic wire which looks like  the
wire  you just cut. Tie it to each  post, and come back anytime after that. You
can then climb over it without being cut. The other type of wire, which is more
secure  or harmful, depending on how you look at it, is a rolled, circular wire
commonly called Razor Ribbon.  One manufacturer of this  is the American  Fence
Co.  which calls  it 'the mean  stuff'. And  it is. The  barbs are  as sharp as
razors. Of course this can be cut, but you will need very long bolt cutters and
once  you cut it, jump as far back as  you can to avoid the wire from springing
into your face. As mentioned earlier,  cutting is irreparable, and obvious.  If
the  wire is  loosely looped, there  may be  sufficient room in  between to get
through without getting stitches and losing lots of blood. If the wire is  more
tightly  looped you may be able to cover  the the wire with some tough material
such as a leather sheet so you can climb over without getting hurt. This method
is not easy to accomplish however. You may want to see if you can get under the
fence or jump over rather than climb it.


Fence mounted noise or vibration sensors:
-----------------------------------------

Let's assume you have found a way to get past the fence. Of course you have not
tried  this yet,  since you  should always  plan before  you act.  OK, you have
planned how you would  theoretically get over  or past the  fence. You are  now
past  the deterrent and prevention stages. Before  you put the plan into action
you had better check for the things mentioned earlier. If a fence is the  first
step  in  security defense,  then fence  mounted sensors  are the  second step.
The types of detection equipment that can be mounted on the fence are:

Fence shock sensors: These mount on fence posts at intervals of 10 to 20  feet,
or  on every post. They are small boxes clamped about 2/3 up from ground level.
There is a cable, either twisted  pair or coax running horizontally across  the
fence  connecting these boxes. The cable can be concealed in conduits or inside
the fence itself, thus,  making it hard to  visually detect. Each fence  sensor
consists  of a seismic shock  sensor that detects climbing  over, lifting up or
cutting through the fence. So if the  fence is climbable, it would not be  wise
to  do  so since  you may  be detected.  Of  course it  doesn't matter  if your
detected if there is no security force to respond and deter you.

Another type, is  called the  E-Flex cable. It's  simply a  coax cable  running
horizontally  across the fence. This  cable can not only  be used on chain link
fences, but can also be used on concrete block, brick, or other solid barriers.
It  may be on the outside, or  mounted inside the fence, thus, making detection
of the device  harder. Of course  detection of this  and other similar  devices
which  cannot be seen, doesn't make it impossible.  A way to detect this, is by
simply repeatedly hitting the wall with a blunt object or by throwing rocks  at
it.  If nothing out of the ordinary happens, then you can be reasonably sure it
is not in place. This is basically a vibration sensor.

Low frequency microphones: This  is essentially a coax  cable that responds  to
noise transmitted within the fence itself.

Vibration  sensors: These are  based on mercury  switches, a ring  or ball on a
pin, or a  ball on  a rail.  Movement of the  fence disturbs  the switches  and
signals  alarms. A hint that  this is in use  is that it can  only be used on a
securely constructed and tightly mounted fence, with no play or movement in it.
Otherwise, they will be getting false alarms like crazy.

OK,  you know all about these  types, how the hell do  you get around it? Well,
don't touch the fence. But if there  is no alternative, and you must climb  it,
then  climb the fence  where it makes a  90 degree turn (the  corner) or at the
gate. Climb it very slowly  and carefully, and you should  be able to get  over
without  being detected by  these sensors! Make  sure you climb  on the largest
pipe and don't fall.

Security lighting and CCTV:
---------------------------

Sometimes,  fences may be backed up by Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) systems to make
visual monitoring  of  the  perimeter  easier and  quicker.  By  installing  an
adequate  lighting system  and conventional CCTV  cameras, or  by using special
low light sensitive  cameras, the  perimeter can  be monitored  from a  central
point.  Security personnel can then be  dispatched when an intruder is detected
on the monitors.

Some systems are stationary, and others can be moved to view different areas of
the  perimeter  from within  the  central station.  It  would be  in  your best
interest to determine if  the camera is  stationary or not. If  so, you may  be
able to plan a path which will be out of the view range of the camera. If it is
movable, you will have to take your chances.

Light control sensor: This  utilizes a Passive InfraRed (PIR) sensor to  detect
the  body  heat  emitted from  someone  entering  the detection  area,  and can
activate a light or  other alarm. PIR's  will be discussed in  Part II of  this
series.  The sensor has  an option called:  'night only mode'  in which a light
will flash when a person enters the  area, but only during night hours. It  can
tell  if its dark by either a photoelectric sensor, or by a clock. Of course if
its daylight savings time, the clock may not be totally accurate, which can  be
used  to  your  advantage. If  it  is  photoelectric, you  can  simply  place a
flashlight pointing directly  into the  sensor during daylight  hours. When  it
gets  dark, the photoelectric sensor will still  'think' its day since there is
sufficient light, thus,  not activating  the unit to  detect alarm  conditions.
This should enable you to move within the area at will.

Buried Seismic Sensors:
-----------------------

Seismic detectors are designed to identify an intruder by picking up the  sound
of  your footsteps  or other  noises related  to passing  through the protected
area. These sensors have a  range of about 20  feet and are buried  underground
and  linked by a cable, which carries  their signals to a processor. There, the
signals are amplified and equalized to eliminate frequencies that are unrelated
to  intruder motion. The signals are converted to pulses that are compared with
a standard signal threshold. Each pulse  that crosses this threshold is  tested
on  count and frequency. If it meets all  the criteria for a footstep, an alarm
is triggered. These sensors can even be installed under asphalt or concrete  by
cutting a trench through the hard surface. It is also immune to weather and can
follow any type of terrain. The only restriction is that the area of  detection
must be free of any type of obstruction such as a tree or a bush.

Electronic field sensor:
------------------------

These detect an intruder by measuring a change in an electric field. The  field
sensors use a set of two cables, one with holes cut into the cable shielding to
allow the electromagnetic field to 'leak' into the surrounding area. The  other
cable  is a receiver to detect the field and any changes in it. Objects passing
through the field distort  it, triggering an alarm.  This sensor can either  be
buried  or free  standing, and  can follow  any type  of terrain.  But its very
sensitive to animals, birds, or  wind blown debris, thus,  if it is very  windy
out,  and you know this is  being used, you can get  some paper and throw it so
the wind takes it and sets off the alarm repeatedly. If it is done enough, they
may temporarily turn it off, or ignore it due to excessive false alarms.

It  is not hard to tell  if these devices are in  use. You cannot see them, but
you don't have  to. Simply get  3-4 medium  sized stones. Throw  them into  the
place  where you think the  protected area is. Repeat  this several times. This
works on the lesser advanced systems that have trouble distinguishing this type
of  seismic activity from human walking/running. If nothing happens, you can be
reasonably sure this  is not in  use. Now that  you can detect  it, how do  you
defeat  it? Well as far as the electronic field sensor is concerned, you should
wait for a windy night and cause excessive false alarms and hope they will turn
it off. As far as the seismic sensors, you can take it one step at a time, very
softly, maybe one  step every 30-60  seconds. These sensors  have a  threshold,
say,  two  or more  consecutive footsteps  in  a 30  second time  interval will
trigger the alarm. Simply take  in one step at a  time, slowly, and wait,  then
take another step, wait, until you reach your destination. These detectors work
on the assumption that the  intruder has no knowledge  of the device, and  will
walk/run across the protected area normally, thus, causing considerable seismic
vibrations. The problem with this method is that it will take you some time  to
pass  through the protected area. This means there is more of a chance that you
will be seen. If there are  a lot of people going  in and out of the  facility,
you  may not want  to use this method.  Another way would be  to run across the
protected area, right next  to the door, (assuming  that is where the  response
team  will come out) and drop  a large cat or a  dog there. When they come out,
they will hopefully blame the alarm on the animal. The sensor shouldn't  really
pick  up a smaller animal, but odds  are the security force are contract guards
who wouldn't know the capabilities  of the device and  the blame would fall  on
the animal and not you, assuming there were no cameras watching...


Microwave systems:
------------------

In  an outdoor  microwave system,  a beam  of microwave  energy is  sent from a
transmitter to  a  receiver  in  a conical  pattern.  Unlike  indoor  microwave
detectors,  which detect  an intruders'  movement in  the microwave  field, the
outdoor system reacts to  an intruders' presence by  detecting the decrease  in
energy  in the beam. The beams can protect an  area up to 1500 feet long and 40
feet wide. All transmission is  line-of-sight and the area between  transmitter
and receiver should be kept clear of trees and other objects that can block the
beam. Microwave systems can operate in  bad weather, and won't signal an  alarm
due to birds or flying debris.

These  systems work  on the  Doppler effect, in  which they  detect motion that
changes the energy, and sets off an alarm. These devices will usually be placed
inside  a fence to avoid false alarms.  These devices are very easy to visually
detect. They are  posts from 1-2  yards high, about  6 inches by  6 inches  and
there are 2 of them, one receiver and one transmitter. In some cases there will
be more, which enables them to protect a larger area.

To defeat this, you can enter the field, very slowly, taking one step at a time
but each step should be like you are in slow motion. It doesn't matter how hard
you hit the  ground, since it  doesn't detect seismic  activity, only how  fast
you approach the field. If you take it very slowly you may be able to get past.
Detectors of this type get more and  more sensitive as you approach the  posts.
Ergo, choose a path which will lead you furthest away from the posts.


Photoelectric systems:
----------------------

These  systems rely on an invisible barrier  created by beams of infrared light
sent from a light source to a receiver. When the beam is interrupted, the alarm
sounds.  The beam can have an effective range of up to 500 feet. Multiple beams
can be used to increase the effectiveness  of the system, making it harder  for
you  to climb over or crawl under the beams. Photoelectric systems can be prone
to false alarms as a result of  birds or wind-blown debris passing through  the
beam.  The  problem can  be corrected  by  the installation  of a  circuit that
requires the beam to be broken for  a specified amount of time before an  alarm
is  sounded. Weather conditions like heavy fog, can also interrupt the beam and
cause an alarm. This can also be corrected by a circuit that reacts to  gradual
signal  loss. These systems should not face directly into the rising or setting
sun since this also cuts off the signal beam.

As you can see this system has many problems which you can take advantage of to
bypass this system. As with any system and method, surveillance of the facility
should be  accomplished  in  various  weather conditions  to  help  verify  the
existence  of a particular detection device, and to see how they react to false
alarms. Many times, you  will be able to  take advantage of various  conditions
to  accomplish your mission. If  there is only one  set of devices (transmitter
and receiver), try to estimate the distance of the sensors from the ground. You
can  then either  crawl under  or jump over  the beam.  This also  works on the
assumption that the intruder will not recognize that the device is in use.


MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------

Guards: There  are two  types, in-house  or company  paid guards  and  contract
guards. Contract guards are less secure since they do not work for the facility
and if they make a mistake they  simply get transferred to another facility  no
big deal. In-house guards know the facility better and have more to lose, thus,
they are probably  more security conscious.  Be aware of  any paths around  the
perimeter  in which guards can/will walk/ride  to visually inspect the exterior
of the facility.

Central monitoring:  Monitoring of  the devices  mentioned in  this article  is
usually  accomplished  at a  'Central  Station' within  the  facility. Usually,
guards *SHOULD* be monitoring these. If  you have planned well enough, you  may
find  that the guard leaves his/her post to  do various things at the same time
every night. This would  be an ideal time  to do anything that  may be seen  by
cameras.  Unfortunately, there will probably be more than one guard making this
nearly impossible.

Gates: Probably the easiest way to pass through the perimeter is to go  through
the  gate. Whether in a car,  or by walking. This may not  be too easy if it is
guarded, or if there is a card reading device used for entry.

Exterior card readers: An in-depth look at  the types of cards used will be  in
part 3 of this series. But for now, if the card used is magnetic  (not Weigand)
it is quite  possible to attack this. If you have an  ATM card,  Visa, or other
magnetic card, slide the card thru, jiggle & wiggle it, etc. and quite possibly
the gate will open. Reasons for this  are that since it is outside, the  reader
is  subjected  to  extreme  weather  conditions  day in  and day out, thus, the
detecting heads may not be in the best of shape, or since  it is outside it may
be a cheap  reader. In  either  case, it may not work as good as it should  and
can make 'mistakes' to allow you access.

Combinations: The devices listed in this article do not have to be used  alone.
They can and are used in conjunction with each other for greater security.

Diversions: In some cases, a diversion could better insure your passage through
the perimeter. Keep this in mind.

Extreme weather conditions: All  devices have an  effective operating range  of
temperatures.  On the low end of the scale, most devices will not operate if it
is -30  degrees Fahrenheit  or lower.  Though,  quite a  few will  not  operate
effectively  under the following  temperatures: -13 f,  -4 f, +10  f, +32 f. On
the other side of the scale, they will not operate in excess of: +120 f, +130 f
and  +150 f.  It is  unlikely that  the outside  temperature will  be above 120
degrees, but  in  many  places,  it  may be  below  freezing.  Take  this  into
consideration  if a facility has these devices,  and you cannot bypass them any
other way.

I could not have possibly mentioned everything used in perimeter protection  in
this  article. I have tried to inform you of the more common devices used. Some
things were intentionally left out, some  were not. I welcome any  corrections,
suggestions,  and methods, for this article  and the future articles planned. I
can be contacted on a few boards or through the LOD/H TJ Staff Account.


CONCLUSION:
-----------

This article primarily dealt with the identification of various 'tools' used in
physical security for the deterrence, prevention, detection, and response to an
intruder. There also were some methods which have been used to attack,  defeat,
and  bypass these 'tools'. None  of the methods mentioned  in this article work
100% of the time  in all circumstances,  but ALL have  worked, some were  under
controlled  circumstances, some were not. But all have worked. Some methods are
somewhat crude, but they get the job done. Some methods were intentionally left
out  for obvious reasons.  Even though this  article was written  in a tutorial
fashion, in no way am I advising you to  go out and break the law. I am  merely
showing  you how to identify devices that you  may not have known were in place
to keep you from making a stupid mistake and getting caught. The  Establishment
doesn't always play fair, so why should we?

                     Figure 1. 100-B TSPS Console layout

       (Due to 80 col width, picture is a little distorted vertically)
Legend:
         o Abbreviations in all capital letters are ILLUMINATED KEYS
         o Abbreviations in all lower case letters are NON-ILLUMINATED KEYS
         o Abbreviations in upper & lower case letters are LAMPS ONLY

 ie: VFY = Lighted VERIFY key, tim = Unlighted TIME key, Cg = CALLING Lamp

--  Above is the standard AT&T 100-B console layout, while there may be
additional or different keys on the various  consoles, they will generally
resemble the above layout closely.  In the lower right hand corner you will
notice the numbers 0-9 laid out into what resembles a keypad, this is exactly
what it appears to be. The TSPS Operator uses this keypad for keying in not
only routing information (Phone numbers, Inward routings, etc..) but as a multi
purpose tool for entering various numeric codes recognized by the TSPS software
itself. Routing information applied onto the trunks from the TSPS position is
of course in MF (Multi-Frequency). When a TSO keys in a number or routing, the
console buffers the KP+INFORMATION DIGITS until the ST key is pressed, at which
time it plays the buffered KP+INFO DIGITS+ST onto the trunk in a uniformly
spaced sequence. So if you were somehow able to listen in on a TSO actually
routing a call, it would not sound like someone placing a call on a standard
Touch-Tone telephone (or homemade blue box), but more like someone pressing a
"Redial key" on a Touch-Tone (TT) phone. The duration of the tone and space
between the tones are a network-wide standard, although the network in most
cases is quite tolerant to deviations of this standard. (This "loose" tolerance
is what allows us to simulate In-band signalling with our blue boxes).

--   At the upper left hand side of the diagram you will see the Ticket box,
This box has 4 slots marked New, Cancel, Scratch and Completed. I believe this
is used for manually filled out trouble and/or time tickets. As far as I know
manually filled time tickets are a thing of the past, however in case of
equipment failure the tickets are available I assume.  TSO would manually fill
out a trouble ticket to report trouble reaching a number out of her LAN (Local
Area Network - or, The area directly served by her particular TSPS position),
whereas to report trouble with a number in her LAN she would simply key in a
trouble code (utilizing the KP-TRBL (Trouble) key). to automatically place a
trouble report.

--   To the right of the Ticket box you will see the DISPLAY. The display works
in conjunction with certain keys on the console, and is used to display timing
information (hours, mins, sec's), Cost per minute, Calling number
identification (what most people refer to as TSPS ANI), numbers called, and
various special codes. The console display can be in one of two states, either
1) displaying digits, or 2) displaying nothing (dark). Both of which have
different meanings when resulting from certain procedures attempted by a TSO.
LIGHTED KEYS, and LAMPS on the console can be in one of three states either 1)
NOT ILLUMINATED (dark), 2) ILLUMINATED, or 3) FLASHING. Again the state of a
lamp/lamp-key meaning different things under different conditions.


II.                        KEY DESCRIPTIONS & USES
                           =======================

--   Below the Ticket box you will see a row of 5 keys starting with the key
labeled "VFY" (Verify), these are various special purpose keys used by TSPS
that have no real "grouping" unlike the other "Key groups". These are:

(VFY) - Verify, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with the keypad, allows
the TSO to verify (listen in) on a telephone call that is in progress, although
any conversation taking place on that call is scrambled to the TSO, and despite
popular belief THE SCRAMBLING PROCESS IS DONE AT THE CONSOLE LEVEL, AND NOT ON
THE TRUNK LEVEL, SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SEEN REFERENCE TO THE "BLV SCRAMBLING
SHUT OFF TONE" PLEASE IGNORE IT, IF YOU WERE TO SOMEHOW GAIN ACCESS TO A
VERIFICATION TRUNK FROM A NON-TSPS POSITION, THE CONVERSATION WOULD NOT BE
SCRAMBLED.


(OVR SES) - Over Seas, Illuminated key. Used in overseas call completion
through an Overseas Toll Completion Center/Server (IOCC). I believe it also
allows the TSO to key in more than 10 digits (standard POTS) for IDDD call
completion.

(SCN) - Screen, Illuminated key - Lights to notify TSO that incoming call has
an associated screening code, (ie: 74=collect calls only, 93=special billing).
Depressing this key causes the code to show on display, and it's up to the TSO
to decipher the code and explain its meaning to the customer if he/she is
attempting something forbidden by his associated screening code. (ie: Prison
phones have a screening code of 74, allowing them to place collect calls only.)

(INW) - Inward, Illuminated key - Lights to notify the TSO that the incoming
call is "Operator to Operator", therefore she answers by pressing the key and
answering "Inward!". In most cases Inward Operators are actually TSPS, with
their INWARD lamps lit.

(EMR INT) - Emergency Interrupt, Illuminated key. Used in conjunction with
the VFY key, to interrupt a call in progress while a line Verification is being
done, pressing this key causes an audible "beep" to be applied to the line, and
de-activates the console scrambling (for roughly 30 seconds) , allowing the TSO
to talk to the parties being verified/interrupted. Use of this key & the VFY
key, is constantly kept track of via various security & maintenance TTY's and
any abuse/misuse will set off alarms.

--   To the right of the above set of keys you will see three groups of
LAMPS/Keys labled "Non-coin", "Coin 1", and "Hotel".  The TSO utilizes the
condition of these lamps to identify the status of incoming calls. There are
three lamps that are common to each of the three groups, these are: "Sta",
"0+", and "0-" their meaning is identical in each case as you will see below.

(Sta) - Lamp, NON-COIN STA lamp lights when a non-coin caller requires TSPS
assistance in placing an otherwise direct-dialable call (in some rural areas
that have limited DDD features).  COIN STA lamp lights on direct dialed coin
calls that are sent to TSPS for payment collection. HOTEL STA lights on Hotel
originated DDD calls, TSPS also receives room number call is being originated
from.

(0+) - Lamp, Lights to signify that the incoming call was originated by a
customer dialing a "0+telephone number" for an operator assisted call in each
of the three groups (coin, non-coin, hotel/motel).  (ie. if a customer were to
place a "person to person (op assisted) call from a payphone, this would cause
the "0+" lamp in the "coin" group to light, one placed from a residential phone
would cause the "0+" lamp in the "non-coin" group to light, etc..)

(0-) - aka "Dial Zero", Lamp. Lights to signify that the incoming call was
originated by a customer simply dialing 0 (zero), in each of the three
categories (non-coin, coin, hotel/motel).

(PST PAY) - Post Pay, Illuminated key. Coin group only, Depressed by TSPS when
a customer requests a "post pay" call from a payphone, allowing him to deposit
the full charge at the completion of the call.

(Tne) - Tone, Lamp. I believe this lamp lights to inform the TSO that a coin
customer has flashed his/her switchook during a call in progress, requesting
operator assistance, although I'm not positive of this.

(GST) - Guest, Illuminated key lights on all hotel originated calls.

--   Below the above rows of keys and to the far left you will see a row of
keys labled "Outgoing Trunks". TSPS utilizes this group of keys to select
various outgoing trunk groups the keys are used as follows:

(DA) - Directory Assistance, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to place calls to the
directory assistance group.

(R&R) - Rate & Route, Illuminated key. Used to place calls to rate and route, I
believe TSPS now goes to the Universal Rate and Route position known to all you
boxers to be found at KP+800+141+1212+ST.

(SWB) - Switchboard, Illuminated key. I believe this key is used to reach a
cord-board position, although I have no evidence of this.

(OGT) - Outgoing Trunk, Illuminated key. Depressed by TSO to select an outgoing
trunk to be used to place operator assisted calls, special purpose calls (ie.
Inward), etc..

--   To the right of this row of keys you will find the group labled "Ring",
these keys are utilized by TSPS to activate special purpose ring features and
line handling.

(BAK) - Ring Back, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to ring the originating party's
line while holding the forward line in the event that the originating party
looses his connection

(FWD) - Ring Forward, Illuminated Key. Exactly the opposite of ring back.

(CAL BAK) - Call Back, Illuminated key. Used in special operator call back
situations on person to person calls where the called party is not available
but a message is left anyway, I really don't understand it's full potential and
most positions I have spoken with don't either.

(T&C) - Time and Charges, Illuminated key.

(Nfy) - Lamp.  Used in Non-ACTS (Automatic Coin Toll Service) originated calls,
lights to inform TSPS to notify caller of expiration if initial n minute period
(n = number of minutes entered via the KP NFY key at the origination of the
call).

(Chg Due) - Lamp. Lights to inform TSO that more money is needed at the
completion of a TSO assisted coin call, the usual procedure is to ring the coin
station back and attempt to frighten the customer into making the proper
deposit ("If you don't pay we'll bill the called party...").

(Key Clg) - Key Calling, Lamp. This lamp is used by TSPS to determine the
status of an incoming "Operator Number Identification" (ONI) marked caller or
an incoming caller that was routed to TSPS due to an "ANI Failure" (ANIF) Both
call conditions come to as a "0+" call (hotel, non-coin, coin - see above), if
the calling party is marked as "ONI Required" the appropriate "0+" lamp will
light, and the "Key Calling" lamp will be LIT STEADY. If the incoming call was
due to an ANIF, the "0+" lamp will be lit, and the "Key Calling" lamp will be
LIT & FLASHING.

--   Directly to the right of the "Ring" group of key's you will find the
RELEASE set of key's, these two Illuminated key's allow the TSO to selectively
release (disconnect from) either the calling, or called parties by pressing
either the "Release Back" (BAK), or "Release Forward" (FWD) key respectively.

--   To the right of the release set, you will see a group of four key's with
no particular "group designation", these again are various multi-purpose key's
that serve the following:

(SR) - Service (assistance) Required, Illuminated Key. Pressed by TSO to
Forward calling party to a supervisory console (ie. Irate Customers demanding
supervisor), can also be used if she is confused and needs assistance.

(MB) - Make Busy, Illuminated key. Used to "Busy out" her console, lights when
pressed, console will not take any incoming calls until it is pressed again.
(ie: Useful when gabbing, doing nails, or filling out time/trouble tickets).

(Mt) - Maintenance, Lamp. This lamp Illuminates to warn the TSO that her
console has been placed into remote maintenance/testing mode.  A flashing MTNC
lamp indicates a faulty console.

(PT) - Position Transfer, Illuminated Key. A TSO depresses this key to transfer
the call in progress from her console (position) to another console.

--   Below the "Outgoing Trunk" keygroup, you will see a Lamp marked "Cw" Call
Waiting - This lamp lights on every active console to inform a TSO that there
are incoming calls waiting.

--   To the far right of the "Cw" lamp, you will find the AMA group of keys,
broken into two sub-groups, which are "Station" and "Person", a complete
description of each key in this group would require more room than I have
available here, so if there's sufficient interest I will devote another article
to the use of these key's.  Basically these key's are used in conjunction with
the "KP" and "AMA Timing" groups of key's (see below), for attaching the
appropriate class of charge to the call being originated. The keys in the
"Station" sub-class from left to right are "Paid" (PA), which is used to attach
a "Station to Station" originating caller paid class of charge, "Collect" (COL)
to attach "Station to Station" Collect Call. "Special Calling" (SP CG), and
"Special Called" (SC CD) which are both used in "Special" Station to Station
billing procedures, such as third party, or credit card calls. "Auto Collect"
(AT CT), used in coin billing procedures and "Direct Distance Dialing" (DDD),
Attaches a DDD class of charge in cases where you have trouble dialing a number
and require operator assistance in completing a call.  Below this row of keys
you will find the "Person" sub-group of AMA keys, their uses are identical to
those in the "Station to Station" group only they attach a "Person to Person"
rate of charge. The "No AMA" (NO AMA), key is pressed to eliminate a charge for
a person to person call where the called party is unavailable.  Although all
the key's in this group can take on different meanings under different
conditions, the above definitions are suitable for the sake of this article.
All key's in this group are Illuminated keys.

--   Below the "Cw" lamp you will find two keys under the heading "Coin 2",
their uses on "Coin originated (payphone)" calls are: "Coin Collect" (COL) -
which causes the payphone to collect coin, and the "Coin Return" (RET), causes
it to return a coin. Both are Illuminated Key's.

--   To the right of the "Coin 2" group, you will find the "AMA Timing" group.
These key's are used in conjunction with the "AMA", and "KP" groups for:

(CA TMG) - Cancel Timing, Illuminated Key. Cancels AMA timing charges and also
allows TSO to change the class of charge on a call.

(ST TMG) - Start Timing, Illuminated Key. Used to start AMA timing after
appropriate class of charge has been entered, and the calling party has reached
the called party in person to person calls (or in station to station DDD calls,
destination ring has been established).

(CA CAL) - Cancel Call, Illuminated Key. Used in conjunction with the Cancel
Timing key to Cancel a call and mark a "NON-COMPLETED" call on the AMA tapes
(ie. A person to person call where the called party is not available).

(REC MSG) - Record (AMA) Message, Illuminated Key. Used at the completion of
(completion meaning calling & called party are done talking), to record the
time of the call and the appropriate class of charge onto the AMA tapes and
releases their forward connection. --   To the right of the AMA timing group
you will see three columns of four buttons under the heading of Loop Control.
These allow the TSO to access any of the three loops available to her for
placing calls. The keys have identical meaning in each set they are used in the
following manner:


(CLG) - Calling Party, Lamp. Lights to signify person on said loop is a calling
party.

(CLD) - Called Party, Lamp. Lights to signify that person on loop is a called
party.

(HLD) - Hold, Illuminated key. Places a loop into a hold state, the calling and
called party can talk to each other, and AMA timing can be started. The call is
held at the console.

(ACS) - Access, Illuminated key. Used by TSO to initially access a loop.
Pressing this key selects an outgoing loop, and readies the console for placing
a call onto it. It is also used to allow TSO back into a loop(s) in a HOLD
state.

--   To the right of the loop control group you will see the "Keypulse Key"
group, these key's are pressed by the TSO to initialize the keypad parser into
the proper mode for entering information, which is completed/entered by
pressing the ST (START) key (to right of keypad). Their uses are as follows:

(KP TB) - KP Trouble, Illuminated key. Used to enter various TSO encountered
trouble codes such as noisy line, customer(s) were cut off, couldn't complete
call, etc. I believe the format for entering a trouble code is as follows: "KP
TBL + TC + NTE + CN + ST" where KP TBL = KP Trouble Key, TC = 2 Digit Trouble
code, NTE = Number of times Trouble was encountered (1 Digit), CN = Callers
(phone) Number, and ST = the START key. a record of the trouble is made on the
AMA tapes and the calling party is usually given credit.

(KP RT) - KP Rate, Illuminated. Used to enter and display Rate (Charge)
information. Can also be used to display rate information at a customer
request.

(KP HO) - KP Hotel, Illuminated Key. Used for manually entering a verbally
requested room number on  Hotel/Motel originated calls.

(KP NY) - KP Notify, Illuminated key. Used for entering time in Minutes on a
NON-ACTS originated Coin call, when entered time duration is up, it causes the
NFY Lamp (See above) to Flash.

(KP SP) - KP Special, Illuminated Key. Used for entering Special numbers such
as credit card id's and third party billing numbers, causes TSPS software to
automatically query the BVA (Billing Validation) database to check validity of
number/CC, will flash if billing to an illegal card or number is attempted.

(KP BK) - KP Back, Illuminated Key. Used in entering the calling number in ANI
failures (ANIF), and ONI (Operator Number Identification) required situations.

(KP FD) - KP Forward, Illuminated. Most commonly used KP Key. Used to enter
called party's number on all TSO assisted calls. Pressing the ST (START) key
causes the entered number to be applied onto the accessed trunks in MF.

(ST) - Start, Illuminated Key (Found to the right of the keypad). Used in
completing all KP+number sequences listed above.

-- Below the "Coin 2" set of key's you will see the (POS RLS) - Position
Release key, this key is used by the TSO to release her position from the call.
She would hit POS RLS after completing a call, and also to release a person
calling to ask her questions and not actually requesting a call be placed (ie.
Name/place requests, etc..)

-- Below the Position Release key you will see a set of 5 key's labeled
"Display Control", these key's are used to make the console display show
various information. Their use is as follows:


(TIM) - Time, Unlighted Key. Displays time of day in Military format.

(CHG MIN) - Charge per Minute, Unlighted Key. Displays the $ charge per minute
on a call in progress.

(CLG NUM) - Calling Number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the calling
party.

(CLD NUM) - Called number, Illuminated Key. Displays the number of the called
party.

(SPL NUM) - Special Number, Illuminated Key. Display's various special numbers
such as Calling Card numbers, and third party billed numbers. Use of this key
in displaying Calling Card numbers is as follows:  Press it once you get first
10 digits of 16 digit Calling Card, press it a second time and get the second 6
digits of the Calling Card, press it again and it darkens the display.

-- That's it for the key's on the console, on the left hand side of the diagram
you will see the "Multi Leaf Bulletin Tray", this is an all purpose holder for
information leaflets that contain information on special numbers, Rate & Route
information, special non-standard assistance routes, and various other TSPS
related information. At the lower right hand side of the console is the "Number
Plate", this is simply the console's Position number and ID number. It is a
stamped metal plate, I haven't figured out any way to abuse it yet, other than
scaring a TSO by knowing of it's existence.

** That's about it for this article, if there is sufficient interest in TSPS I
will write further articles with more detail on the actual procedures used by
the TSPS operator in call handling and such, I will also be writing an article
on the BOC TOPS (Toll Operator Position Service) operators that have begun to
pop up since the divestiture when I get some better information on the position
itself. It seems that AT&T inwards no longer handle only long distance
assistance in TOPS services areas and the TOPS op's handle all local area
assistance.

Until then, Dial with Care.

The LOD/H Technical Journal: File #5 of 12


                 An Introduction to Hacking TOPS-20s
                                 by
                          The Blue Archer

   To begin with, I would like introduce this article and clarify a few things.
Firstly, this article was written to familiarize interested hackers in DEC's
TOPS-20 (Total OPerating System-20) and give them knowledge of how to
properly utilize its resources.  This article will generally be limited to the
basics, with an advanced article forthcoming.  Secondly, you may have seen
other articles I have written on the Tops-20 a while back. Well this is simply
a better organized and updated article with primarily the same information.
And finally, I would like to say that I welcome any and all questions about
the article or the operating system and would be glad to help out with any
problems. I may be reached on certain boards or through the LOD/H TJ Staff
Account on sponsor BBS's. Anyway, have a good time hacking your local TOPS!

Starting Notes
--------------
o Capital letters in the beginning of a command indicate that those letters
  alone may be typed for the whole command.
o <>: Brackets around any element(s) are required.
o (): Parenthesis are not required unless otherwise stated.
o  D: This symbol refers to control (ex: DA= Control-A).
o  @: Is the general system prompt and is not considered to be typed by the
      user when shown in examples.
o  $: This is the enabled state system prompt (explained hereafter).

                             ----------------
                             /EXTERNAL USAGE/
                             ----------------

                             SECTION I: ACCESS

  The commands for entering and leaving a Tops-20 are LOGin and LOGOut
respectively. The correct usage of these command are as follows:
  @LOGin USERNAME
  @LOGOut USERNAME
Where username is a variable for the account name. Account names may be
virtually anything, depending upon the system. I employ two methods for
attaining usernames. The first, and most commonly known and used is checking
the system status. This is done thusly:
  @SYstat
This will cause the computer to list out various information about the
assorted users logged in and their status and the status of the system as a
whole. This command does not work on all Tops-20 computers from a non-logged in
state, namely versions 6.1 and higher. A second and immensely more effective
method is superior use of the escape character. The complete use of this
character will be discussed later. For use in logging, one types LOGin and
then a letter or series of letters and then the escape key. Depending on the
number of usernames beginning with the same letter(s), the computer will fill
in the rest of the username. Once the letters are in such a way that if one
continued typing, only one valid username could be gotten, the escape key
will fill in the rest if pressed. Here is an example:
@LOGin S(escape)
(the computer responds with a beep because there is more than one username
starting with the letter S, so I type another letter)
@LOGin SM(escape)
(beep once more)
@LOGin SMI(escape)
@LOGin SMIth (PASSWORD)
          ^^
(The computer fills in the 'th' part of the username for me and asks for the
password with the parenthesis and all).
One note: If the computer fills in an account name and then when a password is
tried it responds with a 'not valid account' message, it simply means that it
is a non-loginable files-only account which will be discussed later.
  While trying to gain access to a system, it is wise to use all the pre-login
resources avaiable. On versions 6.x these resources are virtualy nil but on the
older versions, one may sometimes find an incredible amount of help.  To
see what actual help is available, type:
  @HELP ?
Look for certain things like SECURITY and LOGINHELP.  If the system in use is
on a net, or for some reason the dialup number is not known but wanted, it can
sometimes be found in help files most commonly named DIAL, DIALUP(S), and
PHONES. So, to view them, simply type:
  @HELP DIALUPS
Or the name of whatever help file that is desired to be seen.
  The Information command is also a useful command, more fully discussed
later. The most useful Information commands are as follows:
@Information VERSion
  This will display the banner. If the computer, for security reasons, did
  not display the banner upon connection, then this may prove useful in
  identifying the target computer
@Information DEC
  lists the various Decnet nodes available. On 6.x versions
@I DEC NODENAME
   will tell if a path is open to the node or is the object node is currently
   up and running.
@I ARPA
   will tell the status of ARPANET with respect to this particular computer.
Meaning whether or not the software is up and running and the status of
connections.
  Networking will be explained in the advanced Tops hacking file.

                                ----------------
                                /INTERNAL USAGE/
                                ----------------

                          SECTION II: SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

  Under normal circumstances, with the exception of currently running programs,
the exec level (command level) prompt will be either @' or $' depending on
certain options, which will be discussed later. For now we will assume the
prompt is @. This is the place where commands given are executed immediately.
Certain characters are also available for use here (and other places) which
make life on a TOPS-20 easier. Here is a list of those characters:

1) DC: This gets the system's attention. It will break out of most programs and
processes. It may be necessary to type 2 for it to work, though.
3) DO: Halts terminal output without interrupting the program. A second DO
restarts output to terminal. Note: under this condition output is still being
sent by the computer, it is just not printed on the terminal, as opposed to
an actual ceasing of output by DS.
4) DS: Temporarily pauses current output.
5) DQ: Resumes output currently suspended by DS.
6) DR: Retypes current line discarding old line.
7) DT: Prints information including what the program in use is doing, CPU
information, and load average (amount of users on system.)
8) (Escape): The Escape key causes a form of recognition for virtually anything
being done on the TOPS. It will complete commands, filenames, and just about
anything else being typed to the computer. For example I(escape) would result
in the command INFORMATION. For further information on this command refer to
the logging in procedure utilizing this feature.
9) ?: This is used to obtain information regarding what the system is expecting
as input or what the current command options are. It may be used almost
anywhere, including after single or multiple letters, filenames, etc.
example: @C?
would print a list of available exec level commands starting with the letter C.

  Here is a list of commands used to obtain system information:

1) DAYtime: Prints current data and time of day.
2) HELP: Gives help on a wide variety of topics, depending on the system.
For a complete list, type: HELP ?
3) Information: Provides information on a wide variety of topics. For a
complete list, type: I ?
4) SYstat: Outputs a summary of system users and available computer resources.

                          SECTION III: ACCOUNT STRUCTURE

    The TOPS-20 users login and use the system via accounts which are variable
with different privilege levels and access rights. Accounts are specified by
usernames and most of the time the directory names are the same as the account
names as is also common for VMS. So, logging in under the SMITH means that one
is under the account (username) SMITH. To find out the privileges of an
account, type:
@I DIR <USERNAME>
This can always be done to the account logged in under, and sometimes to other
accounts depending on access rights and the security of the other account. This
command prints out information regarding the account specified. It will even
show passwords on pre-6.x versions of TOPS if one has sufficient privs. In
general the two major levels of privs are full and normal. Full privs are
denoted by OPERATOR or WHEEL in the privilege information printed. This level
gives the user complete authority over the system. The normal level of privs
means anything else but OPERATOR or WHEEL. These forms of accounts have limited
access with respect to system operations and other accounts. Access to certain
programs, files, and information is restricted to whatever extent the system
owners choose. Other minor privilege abilities enable the user to perform
slightly more than completely normal users, and sometimes may be of importance
depending on the circumstances.
  Creation and modification of accounts is done through the BUIld command.
Example:
@BUILD <USERNAME>
Where <USERNAME> is the account to be modified (already exists) or an account
to be created (non-existant). Depending on the privs of the account attempting
to build and system restrictions, one may have a great deal or virtually no
power to create and modify. On most systems, only wheels and operators can
create top level accounts (loginable non-subdirectory accounts). File storage
sub-accounts can be created almost anywhere. These are simply accounts in which
files are put, and these accounts cannot be logged into. To see what options
have been chosen for the account being built, simply type:
@@LIST
Other options for the account being built are as follows:
1) WHEEL: This gives the account wheel (complete) privileges. If this option is
chosen, then others may be excluded for it is all-encompassing, it overrides
any and all protection.
2) OPERATOR: Same as wheel.
3) DECNET-ACCESS: This allows the account to use the decnet, assuming there is
one available. DECNET and other nets will be explained in the advanced article.
4) ARPANET-ACCESS: Allows user to use the Arpanet.
5) ARPANET-WIZARD: This command allows the user ARPANET ACCESS and more. This
account has the ability to turn the Arpanet software of the system on and off.
The commands are as follows:
$DESET ARPA ON
$DESET ARPA OFF
Use of DE will be discussed in the next article. The dollar sign for the
system prompt is explained later.
6) IPCF: Allows Inter-Process Communication Facility capabilities.
7) DEFAULT-FILE-PROTECTION: Sets the protection of the files in the user's
directory. The lower, the more secure.
8) PROTECTION-OF-DIRECTORY: Sets protection of the actual account itself. This
means who can connect to it, modify it, etc. Once again, the lower the
protection, the more secure it is against others.
9) PASSWORD: Sets the password for the account. Type PASSword with the actual
password after it.
10) KILL: This destroys the account. This command removes the account from the
system.
To complete the creation/modification, type two carriage returns.

  The system will not recognize the user as having its various privileges
unless it is told that they are there. This is done thusly:
@ENAble
This enables all the user's privileges and changes the prompt to a '$'. All
accounts, even wheels, are considered normal until enabled, so this must always
be done before an action requiring privileges is performed. It is fine to do
this immediately after logging in and leaving it like that, for it does not
save any adverse effects. At all places in this article where there is a '@',
if enabled would be a '$'.

                             SECTION IV: DIRECTORY USAGE

  Directories are storage places for files. Each account has a directory in its
own name, and possibly one or more subdirectories. To see what files are in the
directory connected to at the moment, type the command DIRectory:
@DIR
This will list what files, if any, are accesable in this directory. At the time
of login the computer sets the account's own directory as the one to be
connected to unless otherwise specified by such things as login adjustment
files (to be discussed at a later date.) Subdirectories of an account are
denoted by a period between the account name and directory name. Example:
<ACCOUNTNAME.SUBDIRECTORYNAME>
Subdirectories are dealt with as normal directories for purposes of usage.
Dealings with directories other than the current default directory require the
use of brackets. For example, if one wanted to look in a directory titled
<SMITH>, he would have to type:
@DIR <SMITH>
And assuming his directory is not protected, a list of files in the <SMITH>
directory will be produced. The current default directory (the one connected
to) does not require brackets for usage. Most directory commands may be used on
other directories by simply placing the object directory (one to be commanded)
in brackets after the command.
  Here is a list of some of the more important directory related commands:

1) ACCESS: This command requires the password of the target directory and, if
correctly given, transfers rights to that directory including creation/deletion
of files, etc. The format for usage is:
@ACCESS <DIRECTORY>
2) CONNECT: This changes the current default directory to the specified one. It
may be countered, though, by protection. If ACCESS to the object directory is
on then connection may be established regardless of protection. The command is
used like this:
@CONNECT <DIRECTORY>
3) COPY: This duplicates an already existing file in another directory to the
current default directory or another specified directory. The format is:
@COPY <OBJECTDIRECTORY>FILENAME.FILETYPE
to copy it to the default directory, or:
@COPY <OBJECTDIRECTORY>FILENAME.FILETYPE <OTHERDIRECTORY>FILENAME.FILETYPE
to copy it to another directory.
4) DELete: Deletes the file from the directory. It still exists and may be
retrieved until it is completely removed.
5) EXPunge: Completely removes deleted files from the system forever.
6) FDIRectory: Lists all information about all files in directory.
7) RENAme: Rename a specified file. The format is:
@RENAme FILENAME.FILETYPE NEWFILENAME.FILETYPE
8) UNDELete: Restores deleted files which have not been expunged yet.
9) VDIRectory: List all information about all files in directory specified,
including protection, size, and date and time when they were last written.

    Files in directories are in the form of:
FILENAME.FILETYPE.#
where filename is the name of the file, filetype is the kind of file, and #
is the number of the file. If there is more than one file with the same name,
multiple numbers will be shown. If a number is left out when a command dealing
with a file is typed, then the file with the highest number will be used.
    Here is a list of filetypes and how to properly use them:

1) .BAS: These are files written in basic. To use these, type BASIC or BASIC20
and LOAD them in and RUN, LIST, or modify them in the basic language and SAVE.
2) .BIN: These are binary files containing program data and are generaly not
directly used.
3) .CMD: These are command files. They are files of a series of commands to be
executed. Commands will be carried out as if typed by the user from the exec
level. To use them, type:
@TAKE FILENAME.CMD
They are very useful for performing long processes which must be done often.
4) .CTL: This is a control file for batch jobs. It tells the batch job what to
do when it logs in. Batch jobs are jobs logged into the account which created
it to carry out commands. Further discussion of batch jobs is in the next
TOPS article. The format for usage of these files are:
@SUBmit FILENAME.CTL
5) .EXE: Files of this sort are executable from the exec level. They are
assembled programs in machine language and the fastest sort of program on the
TOPS. To use them, type:
@<DIRECTORY>FILENAME.EXE
6) .HLP: This is basically just a text file. Use the same command as the .TXT
forms of files. If a file of this sort is placed within the actual <HELP>
directory, it becomes available to the whole system by simply typing:
@HELP FILENAME
All information obtained through the HELP command is actually in the form of
files in the <HELP> directory.
7) .INIT: These are initialization routines for various programs. They are not
used directly.
8) .LOG: This is the output of batch jobs. It details the actions of the job
and the responses of the computer. To view, do this:
@TYpe FILENAME.LOG
9) .MEM: This is a memorandum. Often times being inter-office memos and the
like. Use them as any normal text file.
10) .TEXT: This is the uncommon filetype name for a text file. See .TXT for
proper usage.
11) .TXT: These are text files. They contain written information and data to be
read. The command for using them is as follows:
@TYpe FILENAME.TXT

  To use files in other directories, type the directory name in brackets before
the filename. Ex:
@TYpe <SMITH>SECRET.TXT
This applies for all filetypes and commands. Once again restrictions may apply
with regard to protection.

                         SECTION V: SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNICATIONS

  Communication to other system users is done primarily two ways: direct and
indirect. Direct includes chatting with another online user and such, while
indirect is generally done through electronic mail and the like.
  Here are the common commands of direct communication:

1) ADVISE: When this is done, whatever is typed at one terminal is executed at
another. For example:
 @ADVISE USERNAME
Then, whatever is typed will be carried out as if typed from that terminal
until the link is broken.
2) BReak: This breaks all links to the terminal typing BReak.
3) RECEIVE: This allows the terminal to receive either LINKS or ADVICE, as
specified by the command. Ex:
@RECEIVE ADVICE
4) REFUSE: This puts up a barrier keeping links or advice from reaching the
terminal. REFUSE ADVICE is default when logging in, so in order receive advice,
one would have to type the proper command.
5) REMark: Goes into a chat state in which textual information is sent to the
computer and not interpreted as commands.
6) TALK: Establishes a link between two terminals. Ex:
@TALK SMITH
would establish a link with SMITH. Whatever is typed is seen by both parties.
REMark is useful here if a conversation is to ensue.

  Electronic mail can be sent and read through various programs. The most
common ones being MM, MAIL, MS, and RDMAIL. Users are informed when they have a
message waiting upon logging in. Mail is stored in the file MAIL.TXT in the
user's directory. MM and MS are the best mail programs and should be the ones
used, so here is a very brief explanation of the major commands they both
use (they are very similar).
 1)  SEND: This is the command used to send mail to another user. At the prompt
of the respective mail program, type SEND and a carriage return,  the
computer will prompt for information such as the user for the message to be
sent to, other users to receive a copy of the message, and the title of the
piece of mail.
2) READ: This command, if typed with no argument, will start reading all
currently unread mail. If used with the number of a piece of mail, it will
read that one alone.
3) HEADERS ALL: This will give a list of all the titles of the various pieces
of mail in the user's mailbox and the corresponding number of that mail.
  Sending mail over networks will be discussed in the next article. Look for it
in the next issue of the Technical Journal.

                 +--------------------------------+



     This Blue Box is based on the Exar 2207 Voltage Controlled Oscillator.
There are other ways to build Blue Boxes, some being better and some not as
good, but I chose to do it this way.  My reason for doing so: because at the
time I started this project, about the only schematic available on BBS's was
the one written by Mr. America and Nickie Halflinger.  Those plans soon (in
about 90 seconds) became very vague in their context with a couple in-
consistencies, but I decided to "rough it out" using those plans (based on the
Exar 2207 VCO) and build the Blue Box using that as my guide.  During the
construction of the Blue Box, I decided to type-up a "more complete and clear"
set of Blue Box schematics than the file that I based mine on, in order to help
others who may be trying/thinking of building a Blue Box.  I hope these help.

     Note:  You should get a copy of the Mr. America/Nickie Halflinger Blue Box
plans.  Those plans may be of help to anyone who may have difficulty
understanding these plans.  Also, these plans currently do not support CCITT.

+---------------------------------+
| Why should I build a Blue Box ? |
+---------------------------------+

    Many of you may have that question, and here's my answer. Blue Boxing was
the origin of phreaking (excluding whistling). Without the advent of Blue
Boxes, I feel that some of the advances in the telecommunications industry
would've taken longer to develop (The need to stop the phone phreaks forced
AT+T Bell Laboratories to "step up" their development to stop those thieves!).
     There is no harm in building a Blue Box (except the knowledge you will
gain in the field of electronics).  Although there are software programs (Soft
Blue Boxes) available for many micro's that will produce the Blue Box
Multi-Frequency (MF) tones, they are not as portable as an actual Blue Box (you
can't carry your computer to a telephone, so you must use it from home which
could possibly lead to danger).
     Many phreaks are announcing the end of the Blue Box Era, but due to
discoveries I have made (even on ESS 1A and possibly ESS 5), I do not believe
this to be true.  Although many people consider Blue Boxing "a pain in the
ass", I consider Blue Boxing to be "phreaking in its' purest form".  There is
much to learn on the current fone network that has not been written about, and
Blue Boxes are necessary for some of these discoveries.  The gift of free fone
calls tends to be a bonus.

     Note: Blue Boxes also make great Christmas gifts!

+---------------------------------------+
| Items needed to construct a Blue Box. |
+---------------------------------------+
     Here is the list of items you will need and where you can get them.  It
may be a good idea to gather some of the key parts (the chips, and especially
the potentiometers, they took about 6 months to back order through Digi-key.  A
whole 6 fucking months!) before you start this project.  Also, basic
electronics tools will be necessary, and you might want to test the circuit on
a bread board, then wire-wrap the final project. Also, you will need a box of
some sort to put it in (like the blue plastic kind at Radio Shack that cost
around $5.00).

     Note: An oscilliscope should be used when tuning in the
           potentiometers because the Bell system allows
           only a 7-10% tolerance in the precision of the
           frequencies.

 1  | 9 Volt Battery     |             | Anywhere

     The resistors should be a +/- 5% tolerance.
     The speaker can be from a regular telephone (mine just happened to be from
an old Autovon phone).  But make sure that you remove the diode.
     The Potentiometers should have a 100K Ohm range (but you may want to make
the calculations yourself to double check).
     The 9-volt battery can be obtained for free if you use your Radio Shack
Free Battery Club card.
     The Exar 2207 VCO can be found if you call the Exar Corp. located in
Sunnyvale, California.  Call them, and tell them the state you live in, and
they'll give the name and phone number to the distributor that is located
closest to you. The 2207 will vary from about $3.00 for the silicon-grade
(which is the one you'll want to use) to about $12.00 for the high-grade
Military chip.
     Note:  When you call Exar, you may want to ask them to send you the
spec-sheets that gives greater detail as to the operation and construction of
the chip.

| Multiplex Keypad System |
+-------------------------+

     First, the multiplex pattern used in the 4x4 keypad layout. I suggest that
keys 0-9 be used as the Blue Box's 0-9 keys, and then you can assign A-D, *, #
keys to your comfort (ie. * = Kp, # = St, D = 2600, and A-C as Kp1, Kp2   or
however you want).

     Note: On your 2600 Hz. key (The D key in example above)
           it may be a good idea to tune in a second
           potentiometer to 3700 Hz. (Pink Noise).

   Intelligence and Interrogation Processes
   By:  Master Of Impact and the Legion Of Hackers


                              INTRODUCTION:
                              =============

   Doing what we do best always carries the risk of someone, somewhere, wanting
to hold you for questioning. In this article I hope to give those persons who
that are in use (and are in no ways happen to be all new), that can give you
the edge you need to come away "sin faulta". In fact, these interrogation
practicies are used a lot by teachers, local police, the FBI and Secret Service
girlfriends, wives, parents, etc. to obtain information from you that you
probably don't want to give out.

     Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source in order to
obtain the maximum amount of useful information. The goal of any interrogation
is to obtain useful and reliable information in a lawful manner and in a
minimum amount of time. The goal of any source is to deceive or hinder any
attempts of the interrogator to get information out of him.

     This article will deal primarily with the principles, techniques, and
procedures of intelligence interrogation. By reading this article, one
who runs the risk of being interrogated can build countermeasures for common
interrogation techniques. This article has some paraphrased material from a
government interrogation manual but the majority of the information was from
personal experience and prior knowledge of the subject.

     You cannot hope to defeat interrogation techniques unless you first know
what they are. The ones listed herein are the most commonly used. After reading
this article, you should be able to tell when you are being interrogated by
people, and what technique(s) they are using when you probably would not have
known before. Once you know what they are up to and how they are going to TRY
to accomplish it, YOU have the initiative!


                                INITIATIVE:
                                ===========

     Achieving and maintaining the initiative is essential to a successful
interrogation just as offense is the key to success in combat operations. The
initiative in any interrogation must rest with the interrogator throughout the
entire interrogation. He will have certain advantages at the beginning of an
interrogation which will enable him to grasp the initiative and assist in
maintaining the initiative throughout the interrogation.

     The interrogator has a position of authority over you. You realize this
fact, and in some cases, believe that your future might well depend upon your
association with the interrogator. As in the case of police questioning,
"cooperate and we will go easy on you". Like hell they will.

     The interrogator knows the purpose of the interrogation; the source does
not necessarily know the exact reason, but can generally assume (especially
in the case of a computer hacker or phone phreak, which is what the term
"source" will be referring to during this article) because he or she is most
usually conscious of horrible and nasty wrong-doings he or she may have been
responsible for.  Unfortunately for the source, he is generally very much in
the dark about what's happening to his life while it is, in fact, crumbling
around him (temporarily, anyway). This gives the source a not-so-illusionary
behavior pattern of the proverbial chicken who's had its head chopped off.

     Having gained the initial advantage which is quite an understatement,
seeing that, although the risks to the source during the perpetration of
a crime are quite obvious, the possible realistic results of being caught
aren't quite as impressive while one is getting away with a crime than when
one's home is invaded by the JC Penny-suit men wearing mirrored sunglasses,
the interrogator must strive to maintain the initiative applying appropriate
interrogation techniques through the exercise of self-control; by taking
advantage of the source's weaknesses as they become apparent; and by
continuously displaying an attitude of confidence and self-assurance. The
interrogator, however, is 'supposed' to never take advantage of your weaknesses
to the extent that the interrogation involves threats, insults, torture
or exposure to unpleasant or inhumane treatment of any kind. Remember, the
keyword is supposed.

     It is possible for the interrogator to lose the initiative during the
interrogation of a source. If this should occur, he will probably postpone the
interrogation and reassess the situation. If the interrogation is resumed, a
different interrogator will probably be introduced. Following are some examples
of loss of initiative:

* The interrogator becomes angry and completely loses his self-control because
  of the arrogant actions of the source (such as the unbuttoning of a jacket
  to reveal "Secret Service Sucks" spray painted onto the source's T-shirt.)
  As a result, the interrogator loses sight of his objective and concentrates
  his efforts on humbling the source.

* During the interrogation the interrogator fails to note significant
  discrepancies in the source's story. The interrogator may lose his initiative
  as the source gains confidence from his success and resorts to further
  deception, leading the interrogator away from his objective.

* The interrogator becomes overly friendly with the source and allows him to
  lead the interrogation. The source reports only what he believes to be
  important and neglects several significant items of info which could have
  been obtained had the interrogator maintained the initiative.


                           PHASES OF INTERROGATION:
                           ========================

      Approach Phase:
      ---------------

     Regardless of the type of source you are and your outward personality, you
do possess weaknesses which, if recognized by the interrogator, can be
exploited. A human being is likely to:

      o   Talk, especially after harrowing experiences
      o   Show deference when confronted by superior authority
      o   Rationalize acts about which he feels guilty
      o   Lack the ability to apply or to remember lessons he may have been
          taught regarding security if confronted with a disorganized or a
          strange situation.
      o   Cooperate with those who have control over him
      o   Attach less importance to a topic which the interrogator demonstrates
          identical or related experiences and knowledge
      o   Appreciate flattery and exoneration from guilt
      o   Cooperate readily when given material rewards
      o   Cooperate readily when treated as an equal


                                  TECHNIQUES:
                                  ===========

       "File and Dossier"
        ----------------

     The interrogator prepares a dossier containing all available info obtained
from records and docs concerning you. Careful arrangement of the material with-
in the file may give the illusion that it contains more data than is actually
there. The file may be "padded" with extra paper, if necessary. Index tabs with
titles such as "education", "employment", "criminal record", "bulletin boards",
"violated computer systems", and others are particularly effective for this
purpose. The interrogtor will confront you with the dossier at the beginning of
the interrogation and explain that "intelligence" has provided a complete
record of every significant happening in your life; therefore, it would
be useless to resist interrogation. The interrogator may read a few selected
bits of known data to further impress you. If the technique is successful, you
will be impressed with and more importantly, terrified by the "voluminous"
file, conclude that everything is known, and resign to complete cooperation.


      "We know ALL"
       -----------

     This technique may be employed in conjunction with the above or by itself.
The interrogator must first become thoroughly familiar with the available data
concerning you. To begin the interrogation, the interrogator asks questions
based on his known data. When you hesitate, refuse to answer, or provide an
incomplete or incorrect reply, the interrogator himself provides the detailed
answer. Through the careful use of the limited number of known details, the
interrogator may convince you that all the info is already known; therefore,
your answers to the questions are of no consequence. When you begin to give
accurate and complete information, the interrogator interjects questions
designed to gain the needed info. Questions to which answers are already known
are also asked to test you and to maintain the deception that all the info is
already known. A VERY effective technique I might add.


     "Rapid Fire"
      ----------

  This approach technique involves a psychological ploy based on the principles
that:

    * Everyone likes to be heard when they speak; and

    * It is confusing to be interrupted in mid-sentence with an unrelated
      question.

     This technique may be used with one, or simultaneously by two or more
interrogators in questioning the same source. In employing this technique the
interrogator asks a series of questions in such a manner that you do not have
time to answer a question completely before the next question is asked. This
tends to confuse you and you are apt to contradict yourself, as you have little
time to prepare your answers. The interrogator then confronts you with the
inconsistencies, causing further contradictions. In many instances you
will begin to talk freely in an attempt to explain yourself and deny the
inconsistencies pointed out by the interrogator. In attempting to explain your
answers, you are likely to reveal more than you intend, thus creating
additional leads for the interrogator.


       "Mutt and Jeff"
        -------------

     This technique involves a psychological ploy which takes advantage of the
natural uncertainty and guilt which a source has as a result of being detained
and questioned. Use of this technique necessitates the employment of two
experienced interrogators who are convincing as actors. Basically, the two
interrogators will display opposing personalities and attitudes towards you.
For example the first interrogator is very formal and displays an unsympathetic
attitude. This is to make you feel cut off from your friends. At the time when
you act hopeless and alone, the second interrogator appears (having received
his cue by a signal, and is hidden from you), scolds the first interrogator for
his harsh behavior and orders him from the room. He then apologizes to soothe
you, perhaps offering coffee and a cigarette. He explains that the actions of
the first interrogator were largely the result of an inferior intellect and
lack of human sensitivity. The inference is created that the other interrogator
and you have in common a high degree of intelligence and an awareness of human
sensitivity, above and beyond that of the first interrogator. You are normally
inclined to have a feeling of gratitude towards the second interrogator, who
continues to show a sympathetic attitude in an effort to increase the rapport
and control for the questioning which will follow. Should your cooperativeness
begin to fade, the second interrogator can hint that since he is of high rank,
having many other duties, he cannot afford to waste time on an uncooperative
source. He may broadly infer that the first interrogator might return to
continue the questioning. When used against the proper source, this trick will
normally gain complete cooperation for the interrogation.


       "Repetition"
        ----------

     Repetition is used to induce cooperation from a hostile source. The inter-
rogator listens carefully to your answer to a question, and then repeats both
the question and answer several times. He does this with each succeeding
question until you become so bored with the procedure that you answer the
question fully and truthfully to satisfy the interrogator and to gain relief
from the monotony of this method of questioning. The repetition technique will
generally not work when employed against introverted sources or those having
great self control.


       "Pride and Ego"
        -------------

   This technique works effectively on many phreaks and hackers due to the fact
that many are so damn egotistical. The strategy is to trick you into revealing
desired information by flattering you.  It is effective with sources who have
displayed weaknesses or feelings of inferiority. The interrogator accuses you
of weakness or implies that you are unable to do a certain thing.  The proud or
egotistical source will jump to the defensive. An example of an opening
question for this technique may be:  "Why would you own a blue box when you
have absolutely no idea how to use one?" or, "Why do you hack VMS systems if
you can't do a damn thing once you're inside of one?" It provides you with the
opportunity to show someone that you have "brains" and in doing so, you give
the interrogator more information than you should have.


        "Silent"
         ------

   The Silent technique may be successful when used against either the nervous,
or the confident-type source.  When employing this technique, the interrogator
says nothing to you, but looks you squarely in the eye, probably with a slight
smile on his face. It is important for the interrogator not to look away from
you, but force you to break eye contact first. You will become nervous, begin
to shift around in your chair, and look away. If you ask questions the
interrogator probably will not answer them until he is ready to break the
silence. A source may blurt out questions such as, "What the hell do you want
with me". When the interrogator is ready to break the silence, he may do so
with some quite nonchalant questions such as, "You've been logging on to our
system for a long time now, haven't you? Did you hack the passwords yourself?".

    In some cases the interrogator will use several approach techniques
concurrently, or in succession.


                               QUESTIONS:
                               ==========

There are various questions that the interrogator may ask you:

* Prepared questions:  When the topic under inquiry is very technical or when
  legal aspects of the interrogation require preciseness, the interrogator will
  have a list of prepared questions to follow during the interrogation.

* Control questions:  To maintain control and to check on the truthfulness of
  a source, the normal questions will be mixed with control questions-those
  with known answers. If you fail to answer these questions, or answer wrong,
  it will indicate that you are either not knowledgeable in the topic or that
  you are lying.

* Nonpertinent questions:  Sometimes it is necessary for the interrogator to
  keep the true objective of the interrogation from you. By carefully blending
  pertinent questions with nonpertinent questions, the interrogator can conceal
  the true purpose of the inquiry.

* Direct and leading questions:  The manner in which the questions are worded
  has a direct bearing on your response.  A question may be posed in a number
  of ways:

  o "What system did you hack into on 11/11/86?"

  o "Did you break into General Dynamics' computer on 11/11/86?"

  o "You did break into GD's computer on 11/11/86?"

  o "You didn't break into GD'S computer on 11/11/86, did you?"



                         PSYCHOLOGY IN INTERROGATION:
                         ============================

The interrogator will watch for various psychological responses from you during
an interrogation.  Some of these are:

*   Rationalization:  Creating plausible excuses or explanations for one's acts
    without being aware that these excuses or explanations are way off the
    [obvious] reality.

*   Identification:  To identify with and mimic a mental image of some one
    important to you.

*   Compensation: Trying to make up for a psychological weakness by building
    up or exaggerating a psychological strength.

*   Exhibitionism:  Showing off, bragging, etc.

*   Fear, Anger, Frustration, etc.

Of course when being interrogated, you should remain as emotionless as possible
and never show anger, or get upset (NEVER inflict physical abuse upon the
unsuspecting interrogator. This only creates tension between both the inter-
rogator and yourself). Your every move, every response, every action is noted
and used by the interrogator to get you to screw up and give him what he wants.

There can be two main objectives that you can obtain when being interrogated.
The first is to find ways to force the interrogator to lose his initiative. You
can do this in many ways. A few that come to mind are:  Repeat everything the
interrogator says. Mimic the interrogator. Laugh at the interrogator. Basically
piss the interrogator off and make him so mad that he loses sight of his
objective. This may however, get you in deeper trouble, but it may give you
extra time while another interrogator is found.

Lie like hell to the interrogator and piss him off. Such as the pathological
liar gimmick: "I broke into the NSA's computer, yeah, and then used their
network to get into the presidents private computer yeah that's it, the
password was uh...Bonzo, yeah, and then used it to take control of a satellite
used for Star Wars, and made it land right on top of the Kremlin, yeah that's
the ticket!"

You can also change the subject over and over again to totally unrelated things
such as: its a nice day out today, hows the wife and kids, how about some food,
who do you think is going to the superbowl, etc.

The other and probably better objective is simply to pretend to fall for any of
the various techniques used against you and feed the interrogator more and more
bullshit, of course being very sincere. This way he gets totally bogus
information while thinking you are cooperating fully.

Well, I hope you never have to put this article to use in a legal manner, but
you would be surprised how everyday you are interrogated without even
realizing it by normal people who probably don't realize they are interrogating
you!

----------------------
INTRODUCTION / OUTLINE
----------------------

        Basically, the outside local loop distribution plant consists of all
of the facilities necessary to distribute telephone service from the central
office (CO) out to the subscribers.  These facilities include all wire, cable,
and terminal points along the distribution path.  In this article, we shall
follow this path from the CO to the subscriber, examining in depth each major
point along the route and how it is used. This is especially useful for
checking if any 'unauthorized equipment' is attached to your line, which would
not be attached at the Central Office. I suppose this article can also be
interpreted to allow someone to do just the opposite of its intended purpose...

        Note that this article is intended as a reference guide for use by
persons familiar with the basics of either LMOS/MLT or the operation of the
ARSB/CRAS (or hopefully both), because several references will be made to
information pertaining to the above systems/bureaus. I have no manuals on this
topic, all information has been obtained through practical experience and
social engineering.

                          ********************

--------------------------------
Serving Area Concepts (SAC) plan
--------------------------------

        In order to standardize the way loop distribution plants are set up in
the Bell System of the U.S. (and to prevent chaos), a reference standard design
was created.  For urban and suburban areas, this plan was called the Serving
Area Concepts (SAC) plan.  Basically, in the SAC plan, each city is divided
into one or more Wire Centers (WC) which are each handled by a local central
office switch.  A typical WC will handle 41,000 subscriber lines. Each WC is
divided into about 10 or so Serving Areas (depending on the size and population
of the city), with an average size of 12 square miles each (compare this to the
RAND (Rural Area Network Design) plan where often a rural Serving Area may
cover 130 square miles with only a fraction of the number of lines).  Each
Serving Area may handle around 500-1000 lines or more for maybe 200-400 hous-
ing units (typically a tract of homes).
        From the CO, a feeder group goes out to each Serving Area.  This con-
sists of cable(s) which contain the wire pairs for each line in the SA, and
it is almost always underground (unless it is physically impossible). These
feeder cables surface at a point called the Serving Area Interface (SAI) in a
pedestal cabinet (or "box").  From the SAI, the pairs (or individual phone
lines) are crossed over into one or several distribution cables which handle
different sections of the SA (ie. certain streets).  These distribution cables
are either of the aerial or underground type.  The modern trend is to use
buried distribution cables all the way to the subscriber premises, but there
are still a very large number of existing loop plants using aerial distribu-
tion cables (which we will concentrate mainly upon in this article).  These
distribution cables are then split up into residence aerial drop wires (one
per phone line) at a pole closure (in aerial plant), or at a cable pair to
service wire cross box (in buried plant).  The cable pairs then end up at the
station protector at the customer's premises, where they are spliced into the
premise "inside wire" (IW) which services each phone in the customer's premi-
ses (and is also the customer's responsibility).
        Although this is the "standard" design, it is by no means the only
one!  Every telco makes it's own modifications to this standard, depending
on the geographic area or age of the network, so it's good to keep your eyes
and your mind open.

                          ********************

At this point, we will detail each point along the Loop Distribution Plant.

-----------------------------
Cable Facility F1 - CO Feeder
-----------------------------

        The F1 cable is the feeder cable which originates at the Main Distribu-
tion Frame (MDF) and cable vault at the local CO and terminates at the SAI.
This cable can contain from 600 to over 2000 pairs, and often more than one
physical F1 cable is needed to service a single Serving Area (at an SAI).
The F1 is almost always located underground, because the size, weight, and
number of feeders leaving the CO makes it impossible to put them on normal
telephone poles.  Since is is also impractical to use one single piece of
cable, the F1 usually consists of several pieces of large, pressurized or
armored cable spliced together underground (this will be covered later) into
a single cable.

Cable Numbering
---------------

        In order to make locating cables and pairs easier (or possible, for
that matter), all of the cables in the loop distribution plant are numbered,
and these numbers are stored in databases such as LMOS at the ARSB or other
records at the LAC (Loop Assignment Center) or maintenance center. When trying
to locate someone's cable pair, it helps a great deal to know these numbers
(although it can be done without them with experience and careful observa-
tion).  Probably the most common place to find these numbers is on a BOR,
in the "Cable & Assignment Data" block.  The F1 is usually assigned a number
from 00 to 99 (although 000-999 is sometimes used in large offices).  Cable
>pair< numbering is different however, especially in older offices; typical F1
pair numbers range from 0000 to 9999.  Keep in mind that the pair number is not
concrete -- it is merely nominal, it can change, and it doesn't necessarily
have any special meaning (in some well organized offices, however, the cables
and pairs may be arranged in a certain way where you can determine what area
it serves by its number (such as in my area...heh heh); in any case, it's up
to you to figure out your area's layout).  Anyway, the cable-pair number is
usually written in a format such as 02-1495, where 02 is the cable and 1495 is
the pair (incidentally, since this is the CO Feeder cable pair that is connect-
ed to the MDF, it is the one that will be listed in COSMOS).

F1 Access Points
----------------

        Although the F1 is run underground, there is really not a standard
access point down there where a certain pair in a cable can be singled out
and accessed (as will be explained next).  There is, however, a point above
ground where all the pairs in the F1 can be accessed -- this point is known
as the Serving Area Interface (SAI), and it will be detailed later.  In LMOS
or other assignment records, the address of the SAI will be listed as the
TErminal Address (TEA) for the F1 cable handling a certain pair in question;
therefore, it is where facility F1 stops.


-----------------
Underground Plant
-----------------

        The term "Underground Plant" refers to any facilities located below
the surface of the earth; this includes truly "buried" cables, which are
located 6-or-so feet underground surrounded basically by a conduit and dirt,
as well as cables placed in underground cement tunnels along with other
"below-ground" equipment (such as seen in most urban areas).  Whereas the
first type is really impossible to access (unless, of course, you want
to dig for a day or so and then hack into an armored, jelly-filled PIC cable--
 then you should take a bit of advice from our resident Icky-PIC "Goo" advisor,
The Marauder), the latter type can be accessed through manholes which lead to
the underground tunnel.

Manholes
--------

        Bell System manholes are usually found along a main street or area
where a feeder cable group passes through.  Using an underground cable
location map is the best method for locating cable paths and manhole appear-
ances, although it may not always be available.  These maps can be acquired
from the Underground Service Alert (USA) (at 800-422-4133), but often a
"cable locator" will be dispatched instead (usually he will just mark off
how far down or where you can dig without hitting a cable), so this is not
a very practical method.  Of course, you can always follow the warning signs
on telephone poles ("call before you dig", etc) and the spans between SAI
bridging heads until you find a manhole.  The F1 for the SAI nearest the
manhole should be found down there along with others en route to the areas
they serve.
        There are several types of manhole covers, both round and rectangular.
The rectangular ones are sometimes just hinged metal plates covering an under-
ground terminal or cable closure, and these are easily opened by one person.
A non-hinged one may require two people.  Round manhole covers (which, by the
way, are round so that a lineman can't accidentally drop the cover down the
hole) are basically all the same, except for the types known as "C" and "D"
type manhole covers which utilize locking bolts (these can be removed using a
standard crescent or hex socket wrench).  These covers are the same as the
order.  This is aided even further by the fact that since F1's usually last
longer than F2 facilities, there are often more spare provisional F2 facili-
ties in the loop plant (ie. 100 feeders in, 300 F2 out (200 aren't cross-
connected to F1's)). So there is a good chance that you will find one that is
distributed to your area.  Other spare facilities include "floaters", which
are like spare feeder pairs, except they are ACTIVE lines.  Often, a telco will
extend whole feeder groups to more than one SAI in provision for future expan-
sion, including active cable pairs.  If you find a working pair on a feeder
panel which is not cross-connected to a distribution pair, that pair is a
floater.  This is by far the best way to covertly access a certain pair,
because most linemen will probably not be aware of the pair's presence (it
looks unused on the surface).  Beware! If you think you can hook up to
someone's floater and get free service, you're probably wrong (so many other
people have been wrong, in fact, that Pacific Bell has a special "Form K-33"
to report this type of fraud), because the telco is more aware of this than
you may think.  Obviously any toll call you make will show up on the bill for
that line.  A do-it-yourself spare pair activation can avoid this problem, if
done correctly.

--------------------------------
Cable Facility F2 - Distribution
--------------------------------

        The F2 distribution cable is the cable which originates from the F1
feeder in the SAI and distributes individual cable pairs to each subscriber.
This cable can be one of two types: aerial or buried.  The most common is the
aerial distribution cable, although buried cable is the modern trend.  In the
case of aerial F2, the cable or cables leave the SAI underground, and at the
first telephone pole on the distribution span, the cable is routed up the pole.
It then is suspended on the span, such as down a street, and at each group of
houses there is a terminal on the span. This terminal is the aerial drop split-
ter, and it's purpose is to break off several pairs from the distribution cable
in order to distribute them (in the form of aerial drop wires) to each house or
premise.  The location or address of the premise nearest this aerial drop
splitter is the TErminal Address of the F2 serving a certain pair (each group
of pairs in the F2 will have it's own terminal address, unlike the one address
for the F1 terminal (SAI)).  The F2 cable is always the lowest cable on the
telephone pole, and it is usually a great deal larger than the electric power
distribution cables above it.  Often more than one F2 can be seen on a single
pole span.  In this case, the top F2 will usually be the one which is being
distributed to the subscribers on that street, and the lower (and most often
larger) cables are other F2's coming from an SAI and going to the streets
which they service:  These cables consist of multiple spliced spans, and they
will not have any drop wires coming off them (they are marked every few poles
or so at a splicing point called a "bullet closure" which is fully enclosed
and can be quite large (ie. 6" dia, 20" long) as compared to the normal drop
splitters (ie. or similar 4"w x 5"h x 12"l) -- these closures are clamp press-
urized and are not meant to be opened unless the cable is being replaced or
splicing work is being done.  They are not standard cable/pair access points).
        Buried F2 plant is similar to aerial, except that the cable is not
visible because it is underground.  Instead of going to a pole from the SAI,
the cable continues underground.  The drop wires are also underground, and the
method of breaking them from the distribution cable is similar to that of the
aerial drop splitter, except it is a small pedestal or box located on the
ground near the houses it serves.  This address closest to this pedestal is
the TEA for the F2.

F2 Cable Numbering
------------------

        The F2 distribution cable is usually given a 4 or 5 digit number,
depending on the office.  The first 2 or 3 digits should be the number of
the F1 that the F2 was branched off of, and the last 2 or 3 digits identify
the distribution cable. Example-

      F1   Cable                   F2   Cable
             25                          2531
       This F2 cable came from feeder #25^^

        The cable >pair< numbers may be set in a similar way, with the last 3
or 4 digits identifying the pair, and the first digit (usually a 1) identifying
the pair as a feeder or a distribution pair. Example -

      F1   Cable    Pair            F2   Cable    Pair
             25     1748                  2531     748
                    ^--signifies F1 (feeder) cable pair

        Generally, the F1 cable pairs are numbered higher than the F2 cable
pairs, due to the fact that a feeder cable may contain several distribution
cables' worth of cable pairs.  Note once again that all of this numbering
plan is the STANDARD, and it may be far from real life!  As soon as one dist-
ribution pair is replaced, crossed over to another feeder pair, or taken from
service, the set order is interrupted.  In real life, it is most always nece-
ssary to get both F1 and F2 cable assignment data.


                         ********************

--------------------------------------------
Facilities F3-F5, Rural Area Interface (RAI)
--------------------------------------------

        Although cable facilities F3, F4, and F5 may be specified in any loop
plant, they are rarely seen anywhere except in rural areas under the RAND
plan (Rural Area Network Design).  Basically, plants using these extra
facilities are similar to F1/F2 plants, except there are extra cable spans
and/or terminals in the path.  When locating cables, the highest numbered
facility will be at the end of the path, terminating near the subscriber's end
(like a "normal" F2), and the lowest numbered facility will be the feeder from
the CO (like a "normal" F1).  The extra spans will be somewhere in between,
like an intermediate feeder or extra distribution cable with separate cable
access terminals.  One such facility is the Rural Area Interface (RAI), which
can be used in a "feeder-in, feeder-out" arrangement.  This is usually seen on
cable routes of 50 pairs or greater, with a length of longer than 30 kft
(about 6 miles).  In this case, there will be two terminal cabinets in the
feeder path, labelled RAI-A and RAI-B.  The RAI-A is special because it has a
two-part terminal block:  the top has switching panels with 108-type connectors
which cross-connect feeder-in and feeder-out pairs using jumper plugs, and the
bottom has standard 76-type binding posts which cross-connect feeders to
distribution cables for subscribers in the local area of the RAI-A.  The jumper
plugs can only be connected in one way to the switching panels, so random
cross-connection of feeder-in/feeder-out pairs is prevented. In this way, the
cable and pair numbers stay the same as if the feeder cable was uninterrupted.
This is used a lot in rural areas; it allows part of a feeder group to be split
off at the RAI-A like a distribution cable near a town along the route, and
the rest of the feeder group continues on to a town further away, to the RAI-B
where it is terminated as in a "normal" SAI.  In order to access a pair, just
use the last RAI in the span (whichever it is) and treat it just like an SAI.
If the pair terminates at RAI-B, you can also access it at RAI-A! (if you
can locate the pair using color code, BP number, or (ughh) ANI, there should
be test terminals on top of the jumper plugs connecting the 108's on the
switching panel where you can hook your test set -- you can't hook onto a raw
108 connector very easily).  Anyway, the RAI terminal is usually a ground
pedestal with a cabinet such as a 40-type, but it can be aerial mounted on a
pole (hard to access).

Pair-Gain, Carried Derived Feeder
---------------------------------

        Another common facility in rural areas (and in cities or suburbs, es-
pecially near large housing complexes, etc.) is the pair-gain system.  It is
basically a system which consists of a digital link which is distributed,
almost like a normal cable pair, out to a terminal cabinet called a Remote
Terminal (RT) which contains equipment which demultiplexes the digital line
into many "normal" metallic analog telephone lines which go to each subscriber
in the area.  Because the digital line can transmit the audio from several
separate lines and multiplex them onto one cable, only one special cable
pair is needed to come from the CO as a feeder, instead of several separate
ones; this is why it is called a "pair gain" system.  The remote terminal (RT)
contains both the demultiplexing electronics as well as a small "SAI" type
terminal block for connecting the pairs to distribution cables on the side
of the path toward the subscriber.  Because the "feeder" is not a multipair
cable but a digital link (ie. T-carrier), this arrangement is known as a
"carrier-derived feeder."  The SAI part of the RT is used just like a normal
SAI on the distribution side (BLUE), but the feeder side will be slightly
different.  Carrier-derived feeders are always marked with YELLOW labels, and
their pairs will be crossed over to distribution cables just like in an SAI.
So, in order to access a pair in a system like this, you must do so on the
DISTRIBUTION side, because you can't hook an analog test set to a 1.544 Mbps
digital T-carrier line! (or worse yet, a fiber optic cable).  This may be
difficult, because these cabinets are always locked (with few exceptions), so
you'll have to find a terminal closer to the subscriber -- also be aware that
many RT's are equipped with silent intrusion alarms.  Anyway, some common
pair-gain systems are the Western Electric SLC-8, 40, 96, and GTE's MXU,
ranging in size from 8 to over 96 lines.  RT cabinets can often be identified
by the ventillation grilles (with or without a fan inside) which are not
present on SAI's or other non-RT cabinets.

                         ********************

-----------------------------------
Aerial Distribution Splice Closure,
       Drop Wire Splitter
-----------------------------------

        This terminal is the point where the individual cable pair for a
certain subscriber is split from the F2 distribution cable and spliced onto
an aerial drop or "messenger" wire which goes to the subscriber's premises.
In an aerial distribution plant, 2 types of this terminal are common:

1> Western Electric 49-type Ready Access Closure / Cable Terminal

2> Western Electric 53A4, N-type Pole Mount Cable Terminals

     ----------

Type 1>  The 49-type, 1A1, 1B1, and 1C1 closures are all functionally similar.
         This terminal is a semi-rectangular closure, about 15"L x 3"W x 5"H,
         usually black, which is connected directly to the aerial cable itself;
         it is coaxial with the cable, so the cable passes straight through it.
         It splits up to 12 pairs from the distribution cable to a small bin-
         ding post terminal block inside the closure.  Aerial drop wires are
         then connected to these binding posts, and the wires exit the term-
         inal through holes on the bottom.  These wires are strung via strain
         relief clamps on the pole down to the subscriber's site.  The terminal
         closure is opened by pulling out and lifting either the whole cover
         or the front panel after removing the cover fasteners on the bottom
         and/or the sides (the closure is a thick neoprene cover over an alum-
         inum frame).  Inside the case, there is a terminal block and there
         may be some sort of loading coil as well.  The cable and this coil are
         not openable, but the terminal block is.  Since the F2 pair terminates
         in this closure, the F2 BP number (cable/assignment data) corresponds
         to a binding post on this terminal block.  As mentioned earlier, this
         terminal will also contain spare pairs, in case a subscriber wants
         another line.  In order to use one of these pairs, you must either get
         an F2 (and then F1) CP number from LAC using the BP, or you can put a
         trace tone on the pair at the aerial closure and then locate the pair
         at the SAI.  Then a cross-connect would have to be made to an active
         F1 pair, and a drop wire (ughh) would have to be added back at the
         aerial closure.  Anyway, both the binding posts as well as the holes
         (inside + out) are numbered left to right, so you may not even have
         to open the closure if you are just looking for an F2 BP number --
         just trace the drop wire from the house into the numbered hole on the
         closure. The TErminal Address for the F2 is the address of the house
         or premise closest to the pole near this closure.  These terminals
         (esp. 1A1, etc) are also used for straight and branch splices for
         aerial cables, so you may see one cable in / two out;  also, the
         closure can be used for splicing only, so there may not be drop wires
         (in this case, it wont be listed in LMOS because it is not a terminal
         point).  There is generally one of these every pole near a quad of
         houses or so, mounted on the cable about an arm's length from the
         pole.

Type 2>  Both the 53A4 and the N-type terminals serve the same function as
         the 49-type just described, except they are used in situations where
         there are more than 4 houses (8 lines, including provisional pairs).
         This terminal is mounted directly on the pole, about a foot down from
         the aerial cable.  It is not connected in line with the cable, so
         there is no F2 splicing area in the cabinet (rather, a cable stub
         comes from the terminal block and is spliced onto the span close to
         where it touches the pole). It is about 22"H x 9"W x 4"D, rectan-
         gular, and silver (unpainted).  The door is similar to that of a 40-
         type cabinet, but it's much smaller; it is opened using a 7/16" tool
         in the same manner as before, except that the door must be lifted
         before it can be opened or closed.  In this way, the door slides down
         on it's hinges when opened, so it locks in the open position and you
         wont have to worry about it (especially nice because hanging onto a
         pole is enough of a problem).  The terminal block can handle from 25
         to 50 pairs, with 32 holes in the back for aerial drop wires.  Just
         as in the Ready Access Closure, this is the F2 terminal, and the
         numbered binding posts and holes correspond to F2 BP numbers.  The
         TEA will be the address nearest the terminal (just as before).  This
         terminal is common at the first pole on a street, on cul-de-sacs,
         apartments, marinas & harbors, or anywhere there are many drop wires.

Buried Distribution Cross Box and Other Pedestals
-------------------------------------------------

        This terminal serves the same function as the aerial closures, except
it is used in areas with a buried distribution plant.  This cable assignment
for this terminal will be the F2 terminal, and the BP numbers and TEA will
be the same as for the aerial terminals.  Probably the most common cross-boxes
are the PC4,6, and 12; these are around 50" tall by 4, 6, or 12" square respec-
tively, and they are painted gray-green like SAI cabinets.  These are the
smallest pedestals in the distribution plant, and they don't have doors (they
look like waist-high square poles).  In order to open one of these pedestals,
the two bolts on either side half way down the pedestal must be loosened with
a 7/16 hex wrench; then the front cover can be lifted up, out, and off the
rest of the closure.  These terminals are located generally near small groups
of houses (up to about 12 lines usually) on the ground, often near other
utility cabinets (such as electric power transformers, etc).  These are
becoming more common as the new housing tracts use buried distribution plant.
The F2 cable will enter as a cable stub, and it is split into service wires
which go back underground to the subscribers.
        All small pedestals are not necessarily the above type of terminal;
these pedestal closures are often used for other purposes, such as splicing
points in underground distribution, loading coil mounting, and even used as
temporary wire storage containers.  If the terminal contains a terminal
block or it is a significant point on the line, however, it will be listed in
LMOS.  An example of this is a distribution path found by Mark Tabas in a
Mountain Bell area --  there was a small PC12-type closure on the ground near
a street in a remote suburb, and it was serving as a terminal point for a
whole F1 cable.  It was listed as the F1 terminal, and it was at the right
TEA; however, there was no terminal block because it was a splicing point
(just a bunch of pairs connected with Scotchlok plastic connectors which are
hung on a bar in the pedestal closure), so LMOS had no BP number.  Instead,
a color code was listed (see appendix) for the pair in the splice.  Anyway,
the WHOLE F1 went up to an N-type closure on a pole and was split into drop
wires.

--------------------------------------
Multi-Line Building Entrance Terminals
--------------------------------------

        This terminal takes the aerial drop or service wires and cross-connects
them over to the Inside Wire (IW) in the subscriber's building (hotels, busi-
nesses, etc).  There are many different types of terminal blocks for this
terminal, although by far the most common is the Western Electric 66 block.
The 66-type terminal uses a block of metal clips; the wire is pushed onto the
clip with a punch-down tool which also strips the wire.  The block is divided
into horizontal rows which can have from 2 to over 6 clips each.  Since each
row group terminates one pair, two rows are needed for x-connect, one on top of
the other.  The service or drop wire usually enters on the left, and the
inside wire is connected to the far right.  In order to locate a pair, usually
you can visually trace either the service wire or the inside wire to the
block, and often the inside wire side wil be numbered or labelled with an
address, phone number, etc.  It is also possible for this terminal to serve
as an F2 terminal point, if there are a lot of lines.  In this case, LMOS will
list the TEA usually with some physical direction as to where to find it. The
left side will then be numbered as F2 BP's. This terminal is also the demarca-
tion point which separates the customer's equipment from the telco's.  The new
terminals often have an RJ-21 connector on the service wire side, such as a
25-pair for PABX or a Bell 1A2 Key, etc.  There are also "maintenance termina-
ting units" (MTU) which are electronic units connected to the line(s) at the
entrance protector; these are sometimes seen in some telcos.  Basically, they
provide functions such as party ANI on multi-party lines, remote disconnect
(for testing or (click!) non-payment), or half ringers (the most common --
they prevent ringing continuity failures on switches like ESS when there are
no phones hooked to the line when it rings).  MTU terminals are often locked.

Single Pair Station Protector
-----------------------------

        There's really not much to say about this terminal.  Basically, it
takes the service or drop wire and connects it to the inside wire in a single
line residence (houses with 2 lines will have 2 of these).  These are at every
house on an outside wall or basement, and there are two main types: the Western
Electric 123 (with a "150-type" rubber cover), and the old WE 305 and new AT&T
200 Network interface (metal and plastic, respectively). These terminals have
one binding post pair and they will have either gas discharge tubes or carbon
blocks to protect the line from lightning or excess current.  Obviously, there
is no BP number (you just have to visually trace the drop wire to find the
protector). This is also the demarcation point marking the end of the telco's
responsibility, as well as the end of our tour.

                         ********************

Bell System Standard Color Code      Use:
-----------------------------------        Take the #, and find it's closest
Pair #             Tip        Ring   multiple of 5.  Use that number to find
-----------------------------------  the Tip color, and the remainder to find
 01-05           White      Blue    the Ring color (remainder 0 = Slate).
 06-10           Red        Orange  (e.g. Pair #1 = White/Brown, Pair #14 =
 11-15           Black      Green    Black/Brown, Pair #24 = Violet/Brown).
 16-20           Yellow     Brown
 21-25           Violet     Slate

Usually if a color code is needed (such as in a splice case) you can get it
from LAC or the testboard; if it's really essential, it will be in LMOS as
well.  This color code is also used a lot on cable ties (usually with white
stripes and ring colors only), although these are often used randomly.

---------
Test Sets
---------
        This is the "right hand" of both the professional and the amatuer
lineman.  Basically, it is a customized portable telephone which is designed
to be hooked onto raw cable terminals in the field and used to monitor the
line, talk, or dial out.  The monitor function is usually the main difference
between the "butt-in" test set and the normal phone.  If you don't have a
real test set already, the following circuit can convert a normal $4 made-in-
taiwan phone into a working test set.  The "all-in-one" handset units without
bases are the best (I tend to like QUIK's and GTE Flip Phone II's). Anyway-

        When SPST is closed, you are in talk mode; when you lift the switch-
hook on the "test set" phone, you will get a dial tone as if you were a
standard extension of the line you are on.  You will be able to dial out and
receive calls.  When the SPST is opened, the resistor and capacitor are no
longer shunted, and they become part of the telephone circuit.  When you lift
the switchhook on the test set, you will not receive dial tone, due to the fact
that the cap blocks DC, and the resistor passes less than 4 mA nominally (far
below the amount necessary to saturate the supervisory ferrod on ESS or close
the line relay on any other switch).  However, you will be able to silently
monitor all audio on the line.  The cap reactance + the phone's impedance
insure that you won't cut the signal too much on the phone line, which might
cause a noticeable change (..expedite the shock force, SOMEONE'S ON MY LINE!!).
It's also good to have a VOM handy when working outside to rapidly check for
active lines or supervision states.  Also, you can buy test equipment from
these companies:

ISDN passes first real-world test (ComputerWorld, Nov. 24th, 1986)

     After at least five years development work and prototyping on vendors'
premises, the first operational Integrated Services Digital Network involving
customer premises equipment was successfully tested.

     In two initial tests, Arizona government officials transmitted both voice
and data between their offices through a Northern Telecom, ISDN digital switch
residing on Mountain Bell's Phoenix Central Office.

     The trial offers participating vendors the opportunity "to evaluate ISDN
technology and determine customer benefits outside the research lab". Customer
premises equipment used in the trial is still in the prototype phase, however.
No time frames for introducing commercial offerings were discussed.

     In the first of two ISDN applications demonstrated at a news conference,
Don Cline, Mountain Bell's Arizona VP and CEO, placed a five minute voice call
at the Phoenix Civic Plaza to Arizona Secretary of State Rose Mofford and
simultaneously transmitted a certificate commemorating the event.  The
transmissions were handled by Northern Telecom's Meridian digital telephone
sets and workstations and passed through a Northern Telecom DMS-100 ISDN
switch as Mountain Bell's Phoenix CO.

     In the second ISDN application an NCR  PC was used to access and alter a
driver's record residing on an Amdahl 5850 host in the Motor Vehicles Division
from two blocks away.

     Sending both voice and data in digital form over the same twisted-pair
telephone wiring is more reliable than analog communications and in the long
run will save a lot of money. Workstations linked over an ISDN basic interface
can be moved as easily as you can move telephones, as opposed to having to
restring coaxial cable.

Long-awaited McDonald's ISDN trial to start in two weeks (ComputerWorld 12-1)

     During the second user-site ISDN trial, scheduled to begin Dec. 16, at
least four rival communications equipment vendors will test whether their
terminal interfaces conform closely enough to the telecommunications standard
to communicate.

     McDonalds's Corp, agreed more than two years ago to participate in the
trial, which is sponsored by Ameritech divested BOC Illinois Bell, because
the fast-food giant wanted the emerging technology for its own use.

     Slated to continue at least through early 1988, the trial ISDN network
will link a variety of workstations and hosts at McDonalds headquarters located
in Oak Brook, Ill., through a Northern Telecom DMS-100 ISDN switch residing at
Illinois Bell's CO.

     The company will start with 50 basic-rate digital subscriber lines and
gradually ramp up to a projected 300 to 400 lines by the end of 1987. The
basic interface defines two 64K bit/sec B channels and a separate 16K bit/sec
D channel to carry data packets and signaling information.

     All the products used in the trial are designed to communicate with AT&T's
5ESS switch. While the basic ISDN interface is sufficiently well defined to
permit different vendor's implementations to communicate, different vendors'
CO switch products still retain software incompatibilities.

     The way terminal adapters communicate via ISDN is still defined by the CO
switch, terminals can be modified to communicate with either AT&T's or Northern
Telecom's ISDN switch, but you can't just unplug a terminal and move it from
one switch to the other.

     Originally slated to be the first ISDN trail to begin operations, the
project was delayed for approximately a month while AT&T finished implementing
software on the 5ESS ISDN switch at Illinois Bell's CO. While the hardware used
in AT&T's ISDN switch is commercial, the software is coming slowly.

Growth forces split in 305 area code

     Southern Bell announced that rapid growth will force them to split the 305
area code in two, with Broward, Dade, and Monroe counties remaining 305 and
Palm Beach County to Orlando becoming 407. "If we didn't make the split we'd
literally run out of phone numbers".

     The split is slated to take place in April 1988, making 407 Florida's
fourth area code and the first new one in 23 years.

------

  617 currently with 533 exchanges will be splitting off into 508 in 1988.
  303 will be split with Denver remaining 303 and 719 will cover Colorado
Springs.

This leaves the following NPA's open: 708, 903, 908, 909, 917
not including X10 where X is 4,6,7,8, and 9.

  Secret Service Buys Telenet Network (Communications Week)

     US Sprint Communications Corp's Telenet Communications Corp subsidiary
has signed a $35 million multiyear contract to build a private data network
for the US Secret Service.

     The contract marks Telenet's first major private network coup in the
highly competitive market of sensitive government communications. While
telenet would not reveal the extensiveness of the network or its applications,
the Secret Service acknowledges having 4,300 employees and about 100 locations
in the United States.

     Data transmission plays a significant role in the Secret Service's
mandate, which beyond guarding the president includes the investigation of
counterfeiting, securities and electronic funds transfer violations and credit
card fraud.

     Encryption or other security measures are expected to be employed in the
new system, but telenet does not provide those functions.

     In addition to its public network, Telenet has sold about 70 private
networks, about 100 hybrid networks using public and private capabilities, and
many hundreds of virtual private networks.

     It will take more than a year to complete construction.

     New Social Security Net (Communications News)

     The US Social Security Administration will install new modems and
diagnostic and control systems as part of a program to establish its Data
Communications Utility Network, which covers 1500 offices in the US.

     The new network will handle interactive Social Security claims processing.
Equipment for this phase is being provided by Racal-Milgo in an $11 million
contract.

Southern Cal to link 11,000 users on net (Communications News)

     The University of Southern California is in the process of establishing a
$21.8 million University Communications Network that will link more than 11,000
users throughout 185 buildings.

     Voice and data will be transmitted over the network, which will use an
AT&T System 85 PBX, a system of local-area networks, and an intercampus
microwave network.

     Approximately 12 miles of fiber-optic cable will be used to link 21 USC
schools. The system will include 10 Information System Networks and 504
Starlan networks.

     The telecommunications project is scheduled for completion in March of
1988.
